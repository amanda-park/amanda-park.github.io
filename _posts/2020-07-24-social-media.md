Over the years, I've become increasingly unimpressed with the impact of social media on our lives. I've found myself happier using online platforms on a limited basis, so I figured it'd be worth talking about why I've reduced my social media usage so much over the past few years.

### It's Designed to be Addictive

The goal of mainstream social media apps in 2020 is to keep your attention on the screen for as long as possible, in what is now known as the attention economy. The person who developed infinite scroll, Aza Raskin, even goes as far to say that "it's as if they're taking behavioral cocaine and just sprinkling it all over your interface and that's the thing that keeps you coming back and back and back." [source](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44640959)

There's also a reason that all the notification bubbles for apps are red, too. They tried out other colors but red was what managed to capture people's attentions the most. 

### It's Bad for Society

The internet was once supposed to be a revelation for society and make us all far more informed and intelligent, and yet it has given us the era of fake news and previously reasonable people believing 5G towers cause COVID. The content that you're shown via these sites' algorithms is often rife with disinformation and is generally tailored based on what Facebook thinks you will "like", not necessarily what is the truth. Because everyone ends up in these specific content bubbles, there isn't one standard of truth like in the past with newspapers. (For more on why losing local newspapers is scary, check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icNirsV1rLA). The side effect is that across the world, democracies are being eroded and we're all increasingly polarized politically. If you want to know more about that, though, I recommend reading Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy by Siva Vaidhyanathan.

### It's Bad for Your Well-Being

Self-worth is not dependent on the number of online friends one has, or the number of likes that a post gets. Back before I was aware of the negative effects of social media I was pretty heavily influenced by these things, and I wish I could tell myself that it all meant nothing. Nowadays, I take solace in knowing that even the co-creator of the like button, Leah Pearlman, felt the same way that I did when I was a teenager.

## Reducing Social Media's Influence

Here are some tips and tricks I've used to mitigate the effect social media has on me:

* Schedule time to do other things. The worst times I get sucked into social media are when I don't have anything to do and thus I end up mindlessly scrolling to kill the time. But since I've given myself goals to read books or work on developing other skills, I've been less apt to waste time on the internet.
* Use monochrome mode on your device. I've had my phone in black and white mode for over a year now, and it makes me far less likely to mindlessly scroll on my phone than I used to. This can also be done for your computer as well. By doing this, the real world looks more colorful and interesting, encouraging you to spend time there as opposed to staring at a screen.
* Delete accounts for certain sites entirely. I begrudgingly keep open certain social media accounts that I find add some value to my life and a lot of people use, but over the years I've realized that some sites that used to take up so much of my time offered very little value in return. I've currently standardized my online presence usage as follows:

**Regular use**:
* Discord (how I maintain regular communication with friends)
* Microsoft Teams (needed for work)
* YouTube (educational and entertainment purposes)
* Feedly (aggregates interesting web content for me to peruse when I see fit)

**Limited use**:
* Facebook 
* LinkedIn 
* Goodreads 
* Reddit (specific subreddits only)
* Twitch 

**Abandoned**:
* Instagram
* Snapchat
* Twitter
* Tumblr
* And of course, MySpace

I have a bad tendency to binge YouTube when bored and occasionally Reddit too, so those are recognized weak points in my current routine. I use some extensions to help keep myself focused and prevent falling down rabbit holes, such as:

* [Leechblock](https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/)
* [DF YouTube (DistractionFree)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/distraction-free-for-yout/phkbibdikeplendadpamkgknoanodbnh)
* [News Feed Eradicator (if Facebook is a big problem for you)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg)

If you're interested in reducing your social media usage, I recommend trying out a few of those tools and seeing what works for you. And if you're really serious about cutting back on social media use, I recommend reading Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport and following the strategy he suggests there.
