I don't blog very often anymore, but during the height of COVID-19 and lockdown, it was a hobby that gave me a sense of control when the world felt like it was in total chaos. I've brought over some of those blog posts to this new page for future reference.

If you're curious about my professional credentials, I've got 5 years of healthcare data science and analytics experience and a Master's degree in Statistics. I've built predictive models for key business initiatives such as COVID-19 hospital census and inpatient deterioration.

As far as my personal interests go, I enjoy RPGs of both the tabletop and video game variety, I'm passionate about disability rights activism, and my sports team of interest is the (hapless) New York Giants.
