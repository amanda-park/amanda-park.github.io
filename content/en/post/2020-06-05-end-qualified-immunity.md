My thoughts are effectively summed up by this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_FE78X-qdY). Hasan does a far better job articulating things than I could hope to in a blog post and what needs to be done for there to be meaningful change.

**Do what he says in the video if you care about meaningful change.**
