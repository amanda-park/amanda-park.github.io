<li>After you have a chance to get to know someone a little, saying something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve really enjoyed talking to you. I‚Äôm trying to build my friend network and I think you‚Äôre great and would love to hang out sometime. Would you be into that?‚Äù</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="join-groups-and-attend-events">Join Groups and Attend Events</h3>
<ul>
<li>Join groups
<ul>
<li>Meetup</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Local church</li>
<li>Identify new activities or topics you want to pursue
<ul>
<li>If it‚Äôs a hobby you‚Äôre tangentially interested in, go once or twice to see if you like it, but don‚Äôt make yourself go if you hate it (ie, golf)</li>
<li>If it‚Äôs a hobby you know you like, put in a lot of effort to get involved</li>
<li>If a group isn‚Äôt around, start a group</li>
<li>Host group gatherings with new friends</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Go to events
<ul>
<li>How likely is it that I‚Äôll interact with a person at an event?</li>
<li>How likely is it that I‚Äôll enjoy myself at this event?</li>
<li>Ex: go to shows or restaurants alone</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Find a third place, which:
<ul>
<li>Is separate from the workplace and the home</li>
<li>Is on neutral ground (no incentive to stay)</li>
<li>Leveling place (anyone is welcome, accessible and accommodating)</li>
<li>Conversation that is lighthearted is the main activity</li>
<li>Has to be low-profile / not require spending lots of money</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>Bars/pubs/taverns</li>
<li>Cafes/coffee shops</li>
<li>Parks</li>
<li>Bookshops</li>
<li>FLGS</li>
<li>Churches</li>
<li>Libraries</li>
<li>Community centers</li>
<li>Malls</li>
<li>Recreation centers</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Focus on yourself first (fill your life with play and pursue your own goals and interests)</li>
<li>Seek more rejection, not less</li>
<li>Be more selective in friendships</li>
<li>Drop expectations of others, focus on giving to others without reciprocity</li>
</ul>

<section id="express-vulnerability-and-authenticity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="express-vulnerability-and-authenticity">Express Vulnerability and Authenticity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Be vulnerable first; don‚Äôt wait for the other person</li>
<li>Be vulnerable first even if it‚Äôs scary. Remember you‚Äôre not practicing it because it‚Äôs comfortable; you‚Äôre doing it because it aligns with your values and highest self
<ul>
<li>Others won‚Äôt judge you for your vulnerability as much as you think, and you might be perceived positively for doing so</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tell others when you want to be friends with them</li>
<li>Avoid oversharing, as that can push others away and cause you harm. Similarly, don‚Äôt keep being authentic with those that treat you poorly for doing so</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt feel like you need to become someone else to be liked; faking it is draining, and at its core it‚Äôs a manipulative and inauthentic approach</li>
