</ol></li>
<li>Triangularity
<ol type="a">
<li>Do I have triangularity now? If not, how can I get it?</li>

</ol></li>
<li>Skill vs Chance
<ol type="a">
<li>Are my players here to be judged (skill) or to take risks (chance)?</li>
<li>Skill tends to be more serious than chance: is my game serious or casual?</li>
<li>Are parts of my game tedious? If so, will adding elements of chance enliven them?</li>

<li>Can experts meaningfully compete at my game?</li>
<li>Can experts generally be sure they will defeat novices?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Cooperation
<ol type="a">
<li>Cooperation requires communication. Do my players have enough opportunity to communicate? How could communication be enhanced?</li>
<li>Are my players friends already, or are they strangers? If they are strangers, can I help them break the ice?</li>
<li>Is there synergy (2 + 2 = 5) or antergy (2 + 2 = 3) when the players work together? Why?</li>
<li>Do all the players have the same role, or do they have special jobs?</li>
<li>Cooperation is greatly enhanced when there is no way an individual can do a task alone. Does my game have tasks like that?</li>
<li>Tasks that force communication inspire cooperation. Do any of my tasks force communication?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Competition vs Cooperation
<ol type="a">
<li>If “1” is competition and “10” is cooperation, what number should my game get?</li>
<li>Can I give players a choice whether to play cooperatively or competitively?</li>

<li>Is team competition something that makes sense for my game? Is my game more fun with team competition or with solo competition?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Reward
<ol type="a">
<li>What rewards is my game giving out now? Can it give out others as well?</li>
<li>Are players excited when they get rewards in my game, or are they bored by them? Why?</li>
<li>Getting a reward you don’t understand is like getting no reward at all. Do my players understand the rewards they are getting?</li>
<li>Are the rewards my game gives out too regular? Can they be given out in a more variable way?</li>

<li>Do new players find the interface intuitive? If not, can it be made more intuitive, somehow? Would allowing players to customize the controls help or hurt?</li>
<li>Does the interface work well in all situations, or are there cases (near a corner, going very fast, etc.) when it behaves in ways that will confuse the player?</li>
<li>Can players continue to use the interface well in stressful situations, or do they start fumbling with the controls or missing crucial information? If so, how can this be improved?</li>
<li>Does anything confuse players about the interface? On which of the six interface arrows is it happening?</li>
