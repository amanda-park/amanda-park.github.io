<h1>ü¶∏ Characters</h1>
<section id="character-archetypes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="character-archetypes">Character Archetypes</h2>
<section id="protagonist" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="protagonist">Protagonist</h3>
<p>The protagonist is the character who drives the plot, pursues the main goal of the story, and usually changes or grows over the course of the film. A protagonist enters the film with a goal and by the end of the film, they either achieved that goal or did not. The protagonist‚Äôs character arc is defined by the pursuit of that goal. Classic examples of protagonists from film are Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter. All stories must have a protagonist, but not all stories need a hero.</p>
<p>Three types of protagonists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hero - someone we can all relate to, and his downfall will fill us with pity and fear. The hero is the ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù‚Äîthe type of virtuous protagonist the audience roots for and wants to succeed.</li>
<li>Anti-hero - an unlikely protagonist who does not necessarily have virtuous or villainous qualities but who is able to behave heroically if the opportunity arises.</li>
<li>Villain - the villain protagonist is the villain, an undeniable ‚Äúbad guy,‚Äù is also driving the plot as the central character.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="main-character" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="main-character">Main Character</h3>
<p>The main character (aka principal character) is a central character who acts as the audience surrogate‚Äîwe experience the story through their eyes. The main character is involved in the story, interacts with the secondary characters, and is personally impacted by the plot‚Äôs main conflict. The main character and the protagonist are often, but not always the same character.</p>
<p>Reasons to separate main character and protagonist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unrelatable Protagonist: If the audience is not able to relate to the protagonist, the main character can be a more relatable entry-point to the story. In Tim Burton‚Äôs adaption of Charlie and the Chocolate factory, Willy Wonka is the protagonist and drives the plot, but he is also misanthropic and too kooky to be relatable for the audience. Charlie, the main character, acts as the audience surrogate.</li>
<li>Point of View: A main character can act as a plot device to reveal greater truths about your protagonist. In The Great Gatsby, for example, we are able to see the protagonist, Jay Gatsby, as a flawed and dishonest man more clearly through the eyes of the main character, Nick Carraway.</li>
<li>Added irony: A separate main character creates irony or a juxtaposition. Atticus‚Äîan adult lawyer‚Äîis the protagonist of To Kill a Mockingbird, a story about a rape trial with grown-up themes. The story, however, is told through the eyes of the main character, Scout, Atticus‚Äôs young daughter. Scout‚Äôs innocence reveals the flawed moral values of society and the adults around her.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="antagonist" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="antagonist">üí¢ Antagonist</h3>
<ul>
<li>Villain - evil character</li>
<li>Antagonist - character that gets in the way of the character‚Äôs main goal</li>
<li>Obstacle - something that stands in the way of the main character</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="stakes-characters" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stakes-characters">Stakes Characters</h3>
<p>For each character ties to the POV character:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What is the stake that your character has to that character?</li>
<li>How would your character‚Äôs success or failure affect that character?</li>
<li>What happens to your character if something positive happens to that character?</li>
<li>What happens to your character if something negative happens to that character?</li>
</ol>

<section id="character-arc" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="character-arc">üå± Character Arc</h2>
<p>Shorthand for character arcs can follow with DREAM (denial, resistance, exploration, acceptance, and manifestation).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Outer Motivation</strong>: What outer motivation (story goal) is your character pursuing to try and attain her inner motivation?</li>
<li><strong>Inner Motivation</strong>: Which of the 5 basic human needs is your character missing due to the wounding event and its after effects?
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Physiological</em>: the most basic and primal needs, such as food, water, shelter, sleep, and reproductive sex</li>
<li><em>Safety and Security</em>: the need to be safe, in good health, and have stability, both for oneself and loved ones</li>
<li><em>Love and Belonging</em>: tied to human connection and the ability to form lasting bonds, experience intimacy, feel love, and love others in turn</li>
<li><em>Esteem and Recognition</em>: the need to be valued, appreciated, and recognized by others for one‚Äôs contributions, as well as to achieve higher levels of worthiness, self-respect, and confidence</li>
<li><em>Self-Actualization</em>: the need to attain fulfillment through the realization of one‚Äôs potential. This might come in the form of pursuing and achieving meaningful goals, seeking knowledge, attaining spiritual enlightenment, or embracing core values, beliefs, and an identity so one may live one‚Äôs truth</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Outer Conflict</strong>: What external forces (people, organizations, natural or supernatural phenomena, etc.) are blocking your character from achieving her outer motivation?</li>
<li><strong>Inner Conflict</strong>: What internal difficulties (doubts, temptations, secrets, moral dilemmas, flaws that thwart success, opposing desires or goals, etc.) are making it hard for your character to achieve her outer motivation?</li>
<li><strong>The Lie</strong>: What false belief (No one could ever love me; I can‚Äôt trust my own instincts; People are inherently evil, etc.) does the character now embrace because of the wounding event? This could be a belief about herself, an organization, a certain group of people, or the world at large.</li>
<li><strong>Wound</strong>: What traumatic past experience caused the character deep psychological pain that continues to significantly impair her into the present?</li>
<li><strong>Fear</strong>: What specific fear resulted from the wounding event that is now driving the character‚Äôs behavior?</li>
<li><strong>Resolution</strong>: Briefly explain the steps your character will take to come to grips with her past. Make note of specific circumstances or opportunities that will allow her to gain perspective regarding the wounding event, refute the lie she has come to believe, and reject her emotional shielding so she can achieve the goal that will restore her missing need. Use whatever format works best for you, be it an overall summary of what the character will learn or a bullet list of events that will effect change.</li>

<section id="large-scale-structure-of-a-scene" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="large-scale-structure-of-a-scene">Large-Scale Structure of a Scene</h3>
<p>A Scene has the following three-part pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal
<ul>
<li>A Goal is what your POV character wants at the beginning of the Scene. The Goal must be specific and it must be clearly definable. The reason your POV character must have a Goal is that it makes your character proactive. Your character is not passively waiting for the universe to deal him Great Good. Your character is going after what he wants, just as your reader wishes he could do. It‚Äôs a simple fact that any character who wants something desperately is an interesting character. Even if he‚Äôs not nice, he‚Äôs interesting. And your reader will identify with him. That‚Äôs what you want as a writer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conflict
<ul>
<li>Conflict is the series of obstacles your POV character faces on the way to reaching his Goal. You must have Conflict in your Scene! If your POV character reaches his Goal with no Conflict, then the reader is bored. Your reader wants to struggle! No victory has any value if it comes too easy. So make your POV character struggle and your reader will live out that struggle too.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Disaster
<ul>
<li>A Disaster is a failure to let your POV character reach his Goal. Don‚Äôt give him the Goal! Winning is boring! When a Scene ends in victory, your reader feels no reason to turn the page. If things are going well, your reader might as well go to bed. No! Make something awful happen. Hang your POV character off a cliff and your reader will turn the page to see what happens next.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>A Sequel has the following three-part pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reaction
<ul>
<li>A Reaction is the emotional follow-through to a Disaster. When something awful happens, you‚Äôre staggering for awhile, off-balance, out of kilter. You can‚Äôt help it. So show your POV character reacting viscerally to his Disaster. Show him hurting. Give your reader a chance to hurt with your characters. You may need to show some passage of time. This is not a time for action, it‚Äôs a time for re-action. A time to weep. But you can‚Äôt stagger around in pain forever. In real life, if people do that they lose their friends. In fiction, if you do it, you lose your readers. Eventually, your POV character needs to get a grip. To take stock. To look for options. And the problem is that there aren‚Äôt any‚Ä¶</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dilemma
<ul>
<li>A Dilemma is a situation with no good options. If your Disaster was a real Disaster, there aren‚Äôt any good choices. Your POV character must have a real dilemma. This gives your reader a chance to worry, which is good. Your reader must be wondering what can possibly happen next. Let your POV character work through the choices. Let him sort things out. Eventually, let him come to the least-bad option‚Ä¶</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decision
<ul>
<li>A Decision is the act of making a choice among several options. This is important, because it lets your POV character become proactive again. People who never make decisions are boring people. They wait around for somebody else to decide. And nobody wants to read about somebody like that. So make your character decide, and make it a good decision. Make it one your reader can respect. Make it risky, but make it have a chance of working. Do that, and your reader will have to turn the page, because now your POV character has a new Goal.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="small-scale-structure-of-a-scene">Small-Scale Structure of a Scene</h3>
<p>Write ‚ÄúMotivation-Reaction Units‚Äù, or MRUs. Alternate between Motivation and Reaction</p>
<ul>
<li>Motivation is external and objective (something your reader also sees)</li>
<li>Reaction is internal and subjective (character reaction to the motivation in following paragraph)
<ul>
<li>Feeling</li>
<li>Reflex</li>
<li>Rational Action &amp; Speech</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="microtension" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="microtension">Microtension</h3>
<p>Tension in small moments, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a character has conflicting feelings</li>
<li>Created by the element of surprise</li>
<li>A sudden change in emotion</li>
<li>When things feel off</li>
</ul>
<p>How to add microtension:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dialogue - Examine each line of dialogue. Take out boring and unnecessary words and trivial matters. Go for clever. Find a way to give each speaker a unique voice and style of speaking. Subtext can hint at what characters are really feeling below the surface, and that creates mystery. Keep in mind the tension is in the relationship between the characters speaking, not in the information presented.</li>
<li>Action - This can be with any kind of action‚Äîhigh or low. Even a gesture is action. So think how to make an action incongruous. What does that mean? Real people are conflicted all the time. Real people are complex, inconsistent. So by having a character react in an incongruent manner, and having incongruent developments in the storyline, will add microtension. Have things happen and characters react in ways the reader does not expect. And, most important, show everything through the POV character‚Äôs emotions. Action will not be tense unless the character is experiencing it and emotionally reacting to it.</li>
<li>Exposition - Exposition is the prose, your writing. It is the way you explain what is happening as you show it. It includes internal monologue. Find ways to add those conflicted emotions and create dissonance. Show ideas at war with one another. Use word choices that feel contradictory. Find fresh, different ways to describe common things.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="food">üçä Food</h3>
<p>First of all, you‚Äôll want to determine the average diet of the people who live in the particular place you‚Äôre brainstorming about. Here are some things to think about when you do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the land like in that area? Different types of land grow different crops. For instance, flat areas that used to be prairies, such as the American Midwest, are particularly good for growing corn and soybeans. Swampy and wetter areas are better for growing rice. A quick google search of ‚Äúfoods grown in [insert climate of your choice here]‚Äù should help with that.</li>
<li>How do they meet their dietary needs? Even if your species isn‚Äôt human, it still needs to feed on something to create energy to run its body. As for humans, however - humans need carbohydrates, proteins, fat, and various vitamins/minerals. We get these from different sources, so in order to meet these needs, we must eat a varied diet. If your people are surviving on food that is either mostly carbs (something like rice or other grains) or mostly protein (something like meat or legumes), your people aren‚Äôt going to survive.</li>
<li>As for nutrients, here is a basic summary of where people get which chemicals they need to survive: Carbs - Grains, fruits, vegetables, anything with sugar or starch in it. Protein - legumes, meat, dairy products, nuts. Fat - mostly animal products, generally, especially meat (although avacados and oily foods like olives also contain fat/lipids). Vitamins and minerals - the vast majority of these come from vegetables and fruits, although some also can appear in animal products (like vitamin D milk).</li>
<li>How easy it to find enough food to survive, for the average person? This depends both on the technology of the society, as well as the economic structure. More advanced technology can mean that more food is being produced (such as giant commercial farms that produce massive amounts of corn), but if the economics aren‚Äôt quite right (the market is out of whack, making food prices too high, or there is rampant poverty despite the technology), it still can be hard for the average person to obtain food. On the other end is subsistence farming, where the person grows/raises their own food to survive, and only sells a little to outside sources (if any). If there isn‚Äôt any agriculture, people are probably hunters and gatherers instead, or they import their food from elsewhere.</li>
<li>How processed is the food? This, again, will depend on technology. Generally, it‚Äôs healthier to eat non-processed foods, but these foods also spoil much quicker, and aren‚Äôt practical if you want to keep your food in storage for a long time. Today, foods are given preservatives and/or pasteurized to keep out germs, as well as keep the food from spoiling. In the past, people used to use either salt or spices to keep their food from spoiling, as well as keeping the food cold (which we obviously still do today). If the foods are over-processed in your society, the amount of unnatural chemicals in the foods might also cause problems for your people and cause them to get sick. Another good thing to consider is how clean the places where your food is processed are.</li>
<li>How much of an environmental impact does the food have, and is it sustainable to gather/grow/hunt it this way? Humans often try to capitalize on a resource for large immediate gains, but if this is done too much, they may not be able to have that resource in the future. With populations of wild animals/plants, if they are hunted/harvested too much, not enough of them will live to reproduce to replenish the population. This can also have negative ecological impacts and reduce/increase numbers of other species (which may or may not have deleterious effects), because if one species is affected, the whole ecosystem gets affected. As for land, if land is farmed too much, the soil can often become infertile and void of nutrients, and the water supply can also deplete because of improper irrigation (for an example of what can happen if land is farmed far too much without proper care, just look at the 1930s Dust Bowl).</li>
<li>What foods are cheaper, and which are more expensive? How healthy are these foods? Is unhealthy food cheaper, and does that create a problem? In urban America, there are places in cities called food deserts, which are usually located in poorer areas, where the only reasonable access to a food source is something like a convenience store, which does not provide adequate food to survive healthily on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are some things to think about regarding the production of food and what your people eat, but here are some things to think about in regard to what your people do with their food, once they have it (basically, different food customs):</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the delicacies in your society? Usually, these are foods that are very rare and expensive (although they may or may not be delicious‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think caviar is especially appetizing myself). Generally, they are mostly enjoyed by wealthier people (or people of lesser income on special occasions), so these are likely to appear either at gourmet restaurants, or at celebrations of some kind or another.</li>
<li>What are some forbidden foods in your society, and why are they forbidden? A food may be banned because it causes extreme health problems, or that it‚Äôs morally objectionable to grow/hunt/raise it. For instance, many people find veal objectionable as a meat source. Food can also be forbidden for religious reasons, and if there are forbidden foods in a religion, it‚Äôs usually outlined in their scripture somewhere. Food can be forbidden for other reasons specific to your story, but these are some of the most common reasons.</li>
<li>What foods are traditional on which holidays? Most societies have holidays of some sort, whether secular or religious, and people usually eat quite a bit on these holidays. Alternatively, fasting could also be a tradition on a holiday, although this would usually be associated with a religious holiday.</li>
<li>What are considered some of the most delicious foods in your society? Cultures definitely differ in that regard, and many cultures consider certain foods delicious that another culture might find repulsive.</li>
<li>How much has the local food been influenced by food from other places/cultures? Has the local food tradition spread to other places? For instance, in America, we have a lot of restaurants that serve food traditional to other countries, but some do it better than others. I don‚Äôt think anyone really considers Taco Bell to be actual Mexican food, but there are other restaurants in America that serve legitimate and less Americanized Mexican food. ‚Ä¢ Do the people take pride in their food and the way it‚Äôs developed? Has your culture/country produced any notable specialties, especially ones that are easily recognizable?</li>
<li>What are some of the traditional dishes of your culture/country, whether they are breakfast, lunch, dinner, desserts, or snacks? Usually, these will be based on which foods are most easily obtainable in your particular area (for instance, a lot of Italian food uses tomatoes, because tomatoes are easily grown in the Mediterranean region).</li>
<li>What are the traditional mealtimes? Usually, people have about three meals a day, but this can vary. Maybe your people have one giant meal and the occasional snack, or they engage in more of a ‚Äúgrazing‚Äù behavior by having three or more small meals throughout the day. Are there any ceremonies involved with these mealtimes, or traditional drinks/foods eaten at specific times?</li>
<li>What are some seasonal foods? What‚Äôs popular in winter, as opposed to summer (or whatever other seasons your region may have)? And why? Does this have to do with holidays that are in this particular season, or just the weather?</li>
<li>What kind of drinks are there, and when are they consumed? These can range among water, juice, milk, tea, coffee, carbonated drinks, alcohol, etc. Nearly every society has some sort of intoxicating drink, so what kind of alcohol is favored by your society, and what it is made of (alcohol is made from fermented things, but these can range from grains to grapes to apples. It depends on the drink).</li>

<p>While discussing communication, it‚Äôs also worth mentioning proverbs, idioms and sayings. The way people draw figurative language from their world tells us about the world and people‚Äôs relationship to it. For example, there is an expression in the South African language isiXhosa, the question ‚Äòunomsila?‚Äô (do you have a tail?), stated when someone enters a room but forgets to close the door behind them.

<section id="economy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="economy">üíπ Economy</h2>
<p>Here are some different types of economies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Market economy (little regulation and free flow, an example would be capitalism)</li>
<li>Planned economy (high regulation and government control, an example would be socialism)</li>
<li>Mixed economy (an economy with aspects of both planned and market economies)</li>
<li>Barter economy (an economy where goods and services are exchanged for other goods and services. Usually lacks a currency)</li>
</ul>
<p>The economy you create for your story world will depend on its context. The type of economy depends on the amount of resources, labor, population, ability to distribute, and occasionally government/politics. For instance, if your story is set in a small, remote village, it is likely to have a barter economy, since the people can just trade among themselves. Of course, having a different economy than that would be an interesting spin to take with a remote village, but it would have to have enough explanation to make it work. As long as the economy makes sense (as with many other aspects of worldbuilding), you should be okay.</p>
<ul>
<li>How equally is the wealth distributed, and by whom? (In a socialist government, I think the distribution of wealth is a lot more controlled by a capitalist government. In the United States, it seems that corporations control most of the wealth and that it‚Äôs not trickling down to the other classes. Many different factors can control distribution of wealth.) ‚Ä¢ What are the resources like around the area? If your people do not have something locally available, how do they get it? Do they use a substitute, or trade for it?</li>
<li>What does this storyworld (or country) have the most of, when it comes to resources? Do they offer it to others, or trade it with others? And on the flip side, what is most in demand in this storyworld/country? And can the economy meet that demand?</li>
<li>What‚Äôs the most important part of the economy, the part that keeps it afloat? Trading? Manufacturing? Labor?</li>
<li>Does this storyworld have currency? And if so, what is it like?</li>
<li>Is this economy affected by inflation (the rise in price of goods/services) or deflation (the decrease in price of goods/services)? What other issues does this economy have? (No economy is ever perfect, there are always improvements to be made.)</li>
<li>What do people (or your characters specifically) think about the economy? Does it have a big effect on them? Do they try to stay out of it? Do they think it‚Äôs corrupt?</li>

<p>When you are mapping, you can put all sorts of things on the map. Obviously, you will be drawing how the main land mass looks, as well as the water around it. Aside from that, however, here are some ideas for what you can add to your map:</p>
<ul>
<li>Borders marking out where the countries are. If you‚Äôre really into it, and the countries are large, you can even add states.</li>
<li>Major cities are important too, especially the capitals of countries.</li>
<li>In addition to the ocean, you can have other sources of water such as rivers and lakes. When you‚Äôre making cities, the biggest cities are usually closest to a source of water. Sources of water can come from aquifers, too, which are underground, but the oldest cities tended to form around rivers or lakes. Water is important.</li>
<li>Map what the land looks like. Mountains, prairies, deserts, hills, plateaus, marshes, coasts, volcanic regions, tundra, etc.</li>
<li>Major landmarks, tourist attractions, historic sites, religious sites, or monuments.</li>

<ul>
<li>The poles of a planet, which are furthest away from the sun, will generally have the coldest weather. And in contrast, areas near the equator will be the warmest.</li>
<li>Climate is a gradient. Unless you have something weird and supernatural going on, a very hot desert is not likely to border a snowy tundra region. Climate changes gradually as you travel the planet. There are no drastic lines where different climates cut off.</li>
<li>Areas near the coasts of oceans tend to be milder, with less extreme temperature differences (the UK generally has pretty mild, rainy weather, since nearly all its land is within a short distance of the ocean compared to a larger country like America). Areas toward the middle of the continent away from the coast tend to have more extreme temperatures (the Midwest US, for instance, has very hot summers and very cold winters).</li>

<li>A form of government in which power is vested in the people. In larger nations, this is through freely elected representatives, although some forms of ‚Äúdirect‚Äù democracy exist in smaller form (majority rule), where people vote directly on legislation as a single body. There are various ways to go about a democracy, depending on the size of the group of people, the people representing themselves, and how their power is expressed.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Republic ‚Äì Rule by Representatives‚Äì ‚ÄúA balance of power‚Äù
<ul>
<li>Republics are ruled by elected individuals, whose duty is to represent the needs of their citizens, and exercise power on behalf of the people, according to the law of the land. Often times, these representatives are part of a house, parliament, or divided structure with multiple elected leaders. The kinds of republics often depend on how much power the representatives have vs.&nbsp;the public, and how those representatives are divided.</li>

<li>A familiar cross-section between ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù and ‚Äúrepublic‚Äù. A representative democracy which people elect the representatives, and the representatives have the power to exercise the enacting of legislation. Here, you see a balance of power where ‚Äúmajority rule‚Äù is offset by the representation of the minority, in order to allow all groups of people to have power.

<li>A group of several states which are members within a larger union, which decide on legislation for the broader entity. In a federation, the central authority is a federal government which holds the overall authority, where the states are subordinate to it. This allows overall control over diplomatic, economic, military, and legal issues.

<li>Considered an umbrella term for a society with a few, self-appointed rulers, dominating over a significantly larger body of citizens. This comes in a wide variety of forms, depending on what group is considered the ruling class.

Considered the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù form of monarchy, the anointed sovereign holds supreme authority, not restricted by written laws or customs. These rulers possess ‚Äúdivine right‚Äù to enact their rule how they see fit. More often than not, succession is hereditary, centered on a house or family line. Kings/Queens are tended to by their subjects with servitude, and their reign is considered the will of God.

<li>Constitutional Monarchy ‚Äì Limited Rule of Royalty ‚Äì ‚ÄúFor King and Country‚Äù
<ul>
<li>As ages passed, and the enlightenment approached, revolutions demanded a limit to the power of kings. Unlike an absolute monarchy, the monarchs authority is derived from, or legally bound, by a constitution or legislature. This rule is executive in power, but may be counterbalanced with a parliament or council of other leaders. Sometimes, this is symbolic only. This can be hereditary, or an elected position.

<ul>
<li>A form of authoritarian government characterized by extreme national identity and forcible oppression of opposition. This system is ruled by a dictator of whom is the premiere image of national pride. Opposition accounts for groups of people who do not fit the national (or ethnic) identity, and foreigners of any sort. This is often enforced by militaristic, strong-man attitudes, and considering a certain people ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù either in nation, culture, or ethnicity.

<li>Empire ‚Äì Rule by Expansion‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Sun Never Sets‚Äù
<ul>
<li>An extensive group of states, countries, and territories under a single supreme authority. This government is characterized by expansionism, the conquering of lands, establishing of colonies, and ruling over peoples of various cultures. In earlier times, this expanse was ruled by a single individual (emperor, empress, czar, tsar), but eventually the definition changed to include colonial empires in which the host nation itself was the authority.

<li>Autocracy ‚Äì Rule by Only One ‚Äì ‚ÄúI am Ozymandias, King of Kings.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>A system of government ruled by one with absolute power. This can be a single person, or party. Decisions of this entity are not subject to legal constraints or popular control of any sort. Leaders are treated with fear, grandeur, and imagery of supreme power. With this said, most still require a power structure to rule, including military, nobles, and other elite groups. Succession is most often hereditary, or through conquering or revolt.

<ul>
<li>A political system which recognizes no limits in its authority, and strives to rule every aspect of the public and private life of its citizens. This can be under the power of a single person, faction or class. This is an extensive and pervasive method of rule usually guided by ideology, as the totality of the authority and the ideology can not be questioned. Enforcing such a realm requires near constant surveillance and control. Extreme authoritarianism.

<li>A socio-economic system where all property is communally owned. Each citizen receives a share of the resources based upon their needs. This emerges as a revolutionary ideology, and becomes the basis of a governments economic policy. Communism is not explicit to a type of rule. Ideologically, it strives to be a ‚Äústate-less‚Äù system. However, historically, this system has been accompanied by governments with a single-party autocracy.

<li>Feudalism ‚Äì Rule of Lords and Kings‚Äì ‚ÄúAll according to their station‚Äù
<ul>
<li>A social system in which the nobility hold land from a king in exchange for military service. Down the chain, commoners (peasants/serfs) lived on their lord‚Äôs land in service to them. Peasants were provided military protection, and obligated to perform labor, provide a share of the produce, and pay homage. This relationship between lord and peasant is also referred to as Manorialism. In short, society was structured around the holding of land in exchange for service and labor. During the enlightenment, this way of living came into challenge by revolutions and evolving political theory. At the same time, many critics suggest that the economic system of today still shares similarity to feudalism. Most medieval fantasy fiction sets place in a vaguely feudal society, but some are more historically accurate than others.

<li>Kritarchy ‚Äì Rule by Judgement‚Äì ‚ÄúWe are the law‚Äù
<ul>
<li>A form of government dependent on judges. This is a traditional system based on customary law, rather that statutory law. This means rather relying on independent written laws, the law is passed by oral tradition, and open to the interpretation. While a majority of citizens might broadly agree on those laws, it is up to the judges to rule upon those laws. This grants a broad sense of freedom since there are no concrete statutes to follow (like taxation). However, depending on the customs, the law may still require obligations from its citizens. Also, judges may be considered the ruling class, absent of any judgement upon themselves, or may not be any different from citizens, adhering to the same laws.

<li>Tribalism ‚Äì Rule by Small Groups ‚Äì ‚ÄúBirds of a feather‚Äù
<ul>
<li>A state, or lifestyle organized into tribes, clans, or small groups of individuals within a closed network, often sharing a cultural identity. Loyalty to the social group is key to membership, and its customs dictate the rules of the tribe. Tribes may function as small governments within a larger one, or within an environment away from government, either as part of a hermitage or coven of privacy. Tribes may also refer to the conformity between groups of people. This ‚Äúway of being‚Äù may refer to those of similar occupations or habits. However, any closed circle in tribalism means limited contact with the outside, resulting in limited education and understanding of the broader world.

<li>Timocracy ‚Äì Rule of the Honorable‚Äì ‚ÄúVeni, vedi, vici‚Äù
<ul>
<li>This is a war-like and honor-bound society where only those who possess land may participate in the government, and the ambition for honor, power, and military glory motivates the rulers. Civic honor and political power increases with the amount of property one owns. It is an oligarchy which is not strictly defined by the ‚Äúinheritance‚Äù of an aristocracy, or the ‚Äúabsolute wealth‚Äù of a plutocracy (although often times, can become one of these two forms). You may imagine a society which is run by ‚Äúhouses‚Äù, regardless of whether they are noble, gained by wealth, or obtained deeds of ‚Äúhonor‚Äù, such as efforts in a military campaign. All other citizens are laborers, and exempt from making decisions. Intellectuals are discouraged from office, as the love for honor is greater than reason. It prefers simpler characters with plenty of spirit, better suited for war than peace.

<li>Gerontocracy ‚Äì Rule of the Old ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Elders are Watching‚Äù
<ul>
<li>A system where society is ruled by the elders, or eldest. Some forms are habitual, meaning that it‚Äôs leaders tend towards the elder age group, while others are mandated, requiring a minimum age to qualify. It is common to find gerontocracies in cultures that value experience and wisdom as paramount, such as in theocracies. While traditional, it can take a more modern or futuristic spin. A system that generally honors the old over the new can fit this bill. This form can be seen throughout history, but in fiction, can also exist in dystopian societies where lifespans are increased for the few, and kept short for the many. The most extreme fictional example might see immortals as the few, and mortals as the many.

<li>Diarchy / Triumvirate ‚Äì Rule by Two or Three ‚Äì ‚ÄúTogether, we shall rule‚Äù
<ul>
<li>A diarchy is a government characterized by ‚Äúco-rule‚Äù between two individuals of equal or competing power. Rulers can either be of the same status (two kings, queens), or be of separate rank where their powers are separated (king and a religious leader). A lawful diarchy may hold this system as a tradition that survives through generations, and relies solely on mutual co-operation. However, a ‚Äúde facto‚Äù diarchy might mean that both rulers are actively contesting each-other for supreme rule. A government ruled by three entities is referred to as a Triumvirate. While less common than a diarchy, the separation of powers allow for more executive decision-making within a consolidated power structure.

<li>Socialism ‚Äì Rule for Public, not Private ‚Äì ‚ÄúRedistribution of wealth‚Äù
<ul>
<li>Not a government itself, but a set of policies aimed towards the redistribution of resources to the public, as opposed to private individuals. This often comes as a response to societies which wealth and privilege is tilted too far toward a single group of people, and promotes the flow of resources to the broader populace. The spectrum of leftist formats vary, but they all share an opposition against imperialist power structures and economics, and a support of collectivism. Socialist and leftist societies are most likely to be seen in sci-fi, since fantasy is often rife with feudal, imperial, or oligarchical governments that are pre-industrial.

<li>A government which elevates the talented, skilled, and intelligent into positions of authority. It idealizes the state as a machine, and professes that scientists, engineers, and the highly educated are best to rule, while the rest remained as workers in a class characterized by job specialization and rationed resources. A technocratic society is one that advocates for scientific method over superstition or religion. These states are referred to as ‚Äútechnates‚Äù. These experts are often appointed, rather than elected.

<li>Cyberocracy ‚Äì Rule by AI ‚Äì ‚ÄúMy Logic is Undeniable‚Äù
<ul>
<li>A government that rules by the effective use of information. This system is centered on a complex method of communication (such as inter-connected computer networks) that directly pairs problems with their solvers. The purpose is to address the flaws of ‚Äúbureaucracy‚Äù altogether, which can be a source of corruption, inefficiency, and small power struggles that detract from the solving of problems. Human beings making the decisions create countless inefficiencies which an super-intelligent network, or A.I. system can excel at.This automated form of government is theoretical, as there have been no actual cyberocracies to date. However, such a system could open the door to new forms of democracy, oligarchy, or authoritariansim. This can assist human progress, or hinder it. The risk of a ‚Äúrogue AI‚Äù or ‚Äúsingularity event‚Äù is also a factor.

<ul>
<li>A government ran by chiefs of the military, centered on jurisdictional legalism, carried out by enlisted officers. Unlike a military dictatorship or junta, this is a stable government with full administrative, judicial, and legislative processes. All of these are supported by the law, constitution, and the society as a whole. Interestingly, this system does not necessarily need to be autocratic or oligarchic. However, it is centered on military service as a precursor to citizenship, and that citizenship is required to elect or govern.

<li>Geniocracy ‚Äì Rule by the Intelligent ‚Äì ‚ÄúKnowledge is power, literally.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>This government places the very intelligent at the top of the ruling class. Among these would be scientists, sociologists, and geniuses of high IP (Intellectual Potential), regardless of race or social class. Mandated tests would be taken to ascertain the IP of the populace, placing the top 20% as the electorate, and the top 0.5% as the electable. The mission of such a society is focused on a one-world government, eradicating violence, emphasizing fulfillment of the genii, and saving humanity from itself. However, while addressing the challenge of intelligence and a basis of scientific thinking, it values raw intelligence over practical-use intelligence, and also does not address ethics in scientific progress or leadership, which could result in IP-driven classism, persecution, or even eugenics.

<li>Noocracy ‚Äì Rule by the Mind ‚Äì ‚ÄúInfinity, ahead and behind.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>A social or political system ruled by an ‚Äúaristocracy of the wise‚Äù, a caste of philosopher kings. This society heralds shared wisdom, based on the priority of human mind. This differs from a geniocracy by not valuing raw intelligence, but the practical and political intelligence to steer humanity through the turbulent waters of the future and into a new golden age. However, this thinking is directly opposed to democracy, which is considered a system of irrational (and emotional) consensus. Instead, it presumes citizens to not have the knowledge necessary to achieve their aims, and otherwise do not know any better. No elected politicians. Its best to let the wizened experts assume control. This idea is seen in science fiction more than fantasy. This idea can take multiple forms, such as a non-fundamentalist theocracy, a technocracy that emphasizes experience and awareness over talent, a collective of mind-linked brains, or an extra-terrestrial entity whose mission is to guide humanity.

<li>Demarchy ‚Äì Rule by Lottery ‚Äì ‚ÄúPick a card. Any card.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>Also referred to as ‚ÄúSortition‚Äù, this is a unique kind of democracy which is based on random lottery. Not everyone has power, but everyone is eligible to be selected. In some variations, this is administered as a direct democracy, taking random poll from a populace. In others, it is less democratic, the eligible belonging to a specific class or status, or are gathered to vote representatives rather than engage in direct policy making. This form has been preferred in situations when only a small voting body is needed, and there is intense desire to combat aristocracy, or avoid corruption, favoritism, or bribery. However, being that it is random, there is a chance as always to either have less than desirable effects, or it be used to obscure bribery or corruption further by ‚Äúadjusting‚Äù the chance of a certain group being picked.

<li>Magocracy ‚Äì Rule by Mages‚Äì ‚ÄúExpelliarmus‚Äú
<ul>
<li>An oligarchical organization ruled by the most prominent of mages and spell-casters. This society holds those of magical ability as higher birth and higher privilege, either alongside other aristocracy, or over the mundane altogether. In some cases, only those who can wield magic have a voice in government. One is most likely to see a magocracy at work alongside academies, magical schools, or societies which are ruled by powerful wizards. The society may rely on the type of magic which is most prominent. Mastery in divine magic may be treated similar to a theocracy, where arcane prowess might see parallels to a geniocracy. Mundane citizens may be lowly regarded or persecuted. Naturally, this is a fantastical sort of government, so no real-world examples exist.

<li>Despotism / Tyrrany ‚Äì Rule by Cruelty ‚Äì ‚ÄúCrush your enemies.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>Typically characterizing the crueler nature of a authoritarian government, a tyranny is a state that oppresses its citizens. This can be by depriving freedoms, opportunities, welfare, resources, or things essential to life and prosperity. This can also include acts of violence, destruction, or torture. Despotism refers to governments ruled by a single supreme entity, often known for their brutality and cruelty. This entity is most often a person, but can depict a group, party, faction, organization that flexes their power with disregard to human life. You may often see tyrannical regimes or despotic rulers target or neglect a people, or groups of people within their realm.

<li>Kleptocracy ‚Äì Rule of Thieves ‚Äì ‚ÄúTwo for me, none for you.‚Äù

Conspiracy, theft, and corruption is at the epicenter of government, and its victors are those who overcome the banditry and scheming come out on top. Naturally, depending on whether the environment is within a known den of thievery, or amongst the daylight, thieves may or may not admit to such a thing, so it is rare to see a ‚ÄúKleptocracy‚Äù out in the open. Secrecy and information is of the highest of value to an individuals prosperity and survival. Coin in the right hands, words in the right ear, and a knife in the right pocket can be the difference between life and death. This term is also thrown around as a way to describe a system overwhelmed with corruption, which would function as any other government if it wasn‚Äôt for the overwhelming incentive to lie, cheat, and steal.

<li>Fragile State ‚Äì Rule Coming Undone‚Äì ‚ÄúMy kingdom for a horse.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>A failed state (or fragile state) is defined as one that has disintegrated to the point where the basic conditions and responsibilities of a government no longer function properly. Various metrics are used to judge whether a state is failing, fragile, or failed. The following are signs of a failing state:
<ul>
<li>Loss of legitimate authority to make unified decisions</li>
<li>Loss of control of territory, or recognition of sovereignty</li>
<li>Inability to provide public services or enforce laws</li>
<li>Inability to interact as a full member of the international community.</li>
<li>Decline of human rights, economy, security, public health, and sovereignty</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When in this position, either the state that was will fracture, will devolve into mob rule, will be susceptible to foreign influence or conquering, or will over time and through suffering transition into a system that allows it recover. Recovery requires state development, which can come from either nation-building, war-making, or foreign aid.

<li>A satirical sort of government that I invented one rainy day in my high school years. Inspired by the goblins of Harry Potter, and the Vogons of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, the idea of a massive bureaucracy consisting of 3000+ members where all acts of rule require the proper form. All forms are drafted, and then must be approved by the drafters superior. The superior must review and submit it to their superior. Forms eventually round the entire hierarchy of superiors until it reaches the last person, of whom the original drafter is the superior of. The cycle continues forever, until the timeline for submitting expires, or the conditions for Special Provision X is reached.</li>

<section id="hard-vs-soft-magic-systems" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hard-vs-soft-magic-systems">Hard vs Soft Magic Systems</h3>
<p>First, we have hard magic. These are systems with defined rules and regulations. A hard magic system will have a clear set of boundaries to it. An earthbender can manipulate rocks but not fire. Generally, these rules can‚Äôt be broken, and the reader knows the rules.</p>
<p>Examples include: Fullmetal Alchemist, The Mistborn Trilogy, and Avatar: The Last Airbender</p>
<p>Use a hard magic system if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are going to use magic to solve problems</li>
<li>Your audience is accustomed to the tropes of hard magic</li>
<li>You are okay with jumping through hoops to expand your system</li>
<li>Your magic doesn‚Äôt convey a theme</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we have soft magic. These are systems of mysticism. A soft magic system doesn‚Äôt have hard and fast rules. It is wild and undefined. The reader can see it play out but is often unaware of the mechanics. Gandalf came back to life because he is a wizard. Rules can‚Äôt be broken if you never establish them.</p>
<p>Examples include: Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia, and Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>Use a soft magic system if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to convey a theme through magic</li>
<li>You want to create a sense of wonder</li>
<li>You want the ability to expand easily</li>
<li>You want to be accessible to a broader audience</li>
<li>Your magic won‚Äôt regularly be used to solve problems</li>

<section id="military-police" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="military-police">üî´ Military &amp; Police</h2>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the Period
<ul>
<li>The first and most important aspect of building a military is to understand the warfare of the period your world is set in. Whether it be iron age or space age, you should have a fundamental understanding of how warfare was (or will be) fought. That doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to replicate everything from history or can‚Äôt create your own weapons, systems of warfare, and integrate things like magic to create new types of warfare. And, of course, futuristic settings have a lot less to go off of then historical settings. Even then, it is important to think about how the technology impacts warfare. In an age with super advanced robots, why would humans still be fighting? These are questions you have to consider. Things like tactics, formations, orders of battle, etc. are all really important. For example, in ancient warfare, a lot of battles began with missile exchanges that could last for hours. Battles weren‚Äôt these huge bloodfests, there were lots of gaps and breaks. Armies rarely lost more than 10% of their fighting force. And pitched battles were relatively rare; most warfare was skirmishing, positioning, and sieging.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Military System - Next is seeing what military system you‚Äôd want to use. A system must make sense for the nation. You can‚Äôt expect a hunter-gatherer society to make use of a professional army. Examples include:
<ul>
<li>Citizen Army- citizens generally equip themselves and are mustered in times of need. Notable examples are Ancient Greek City-States and the Roman Republic prior to the Marian Reforms.</li>
<li>Professional Army- soldiers are recruited, trained, and equipped by the state. Most modern armies are professional.</li>
<li>Tribal Army- warriors, either part of a warrior class or not, join up arms when necessary or when they feel like it. Local leaders have the greatest control in this system. ‚ÄòBarbarians‚Äô tend to fall into this category.</li>
<li>Automaton Army- robots to do the battle. They can be commanded by biological beings or AI. Another example would be creatures like golems, risen by magic, or even armies like the undead as long as they don‚Äôt have their own personalities/control.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Feudal Army- Vassals levy peasants and members of a warrior class (like knights) under them to serve their lords. Feudal Europe and Japan are the poster children for this.</li>
<li>The Purpose - What is a military‚Äôs purpose to its state? That seems like an obvious answer: to fight wars, duh. However, it‚Äôs actually more complicated than that. Some armies are more than just soldiers. They are police, emergency personnel, political enforcers, or other.
<ul>
<li>A nation with a warrior army generally doesn‚Äôt control its warriors very well; the warriors often go on raids, fight each other, or otherwise. For example, vikings would bring back slaves and goods from all over, but you couldn‚Äôt really say that they were dispatched by their kingdoms for this tactically.</li>
<li>The earlier Roman armies were conquerors; expanding the state. The late Roman armies were protectors; guarding the empire from invasion. It‚Äôs important to know if your nation has a military geared towards offense or defense.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Nations with holy orders, such as the Teutonic Order, serve a religious purpose as well as a military one. In fantasy worlds, an army may just as well be adapted to hunting monsters or fending off the underworld as they are to fighting regular wars.</li>
<li>Trading nations tend to have militaries that protect their trade interests. Anti-pirate navies and caravan guards are a priority.</li>

<section id="technology" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="technology">‚öôÔ∏è Technology</h2>
<ul>
<li>Energy
<ul>
<li>How does this world get their energy? Fossil fuels? Hydropower? Solar power? Biofuels? Wind power? Nuclear? A society that runs on a certain type of fuel probably does so because that resource is abundant there, so keep that in mind.</li>
<li>How much can they power with their current energy level? You might want to look up the efficiency of their power source, for this one (for instance, burning some fuels provides a lot more energy than others).</li>
<li>How dangerous is their energy source, and what are its costs/benefits for society?</li>
<li>What‚Äôs the technology level required for this particular energy source? A medieval-level fantasy is not going to have the tech for solar power, unless you‚Äôve figured out some way to explain it with magic.</li>
<li>Is their power source renewable or non-renewable? If it‚Äôs non-renewable, like fossil fuels, they‚Äôre bound to run out sometime.</li>
<li>Does this power source produce waste, and if it does, where does it get stored (i.e.&nbsp;nuclear and fossil fuel energy)?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Medical
<ul>
<li>How advanced is this society‚Äôs medical technology, and why? Again, keep this one realistic. A society that hasn‚Äôt developed electricity yet, for instance, is not going to have MRI machines.</li>
<li>How well can they control and cure diseases (such as the use of vaccines, medicines, etc)? The less medical technology they have, the more widespread disease will be.</li>
<li>Do people trust the medical techniques that are commonly used, and why? (this calls anti-vaccine people to mind, who use their own unscientific ‚Äòresearch‚Äô and distrust peer-reviewed actual scientific studies) Does society have a negative intent with these medical techniques, or is it just people being paranoid?</li>
<li>How advanced is their medicine? Does it cause a lot of adverse side effects? Is it even effective at all (think of herbal remedies and such that may not actually work)?</li>
<li>What‚Äôs used for medicine? Do they used plants themselves? Synthesized chemicals? Pills? Liquids?</li>
<li>How expensive is medical care? Do most people have access to it?</li>
<li>How safe is medical technology? Again with this one, the more technology exists, the safer medical procedures are likely to be.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Food and Water
<ul>
<li>What technology does this society use to farm/gather/produce food? Same with water.</li>
<li>Do they rely on agriculture? If so, what plants do they grow? (hint: to survive, humans need carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins and minerals. So societies usually grow a carbohydrate source [a cereal grain], a protein/fat source [animals or legume plants], and vitamin and mineral sources [fruits and vegetables].)</li>
<li>How hard is it to produce food in that area? Flat areas with fertile soils tend to be the best for growing most things. Look up things that are grown in the kind of geography your society has.</li>
<li>Where does the water come from? Are they near a lake? A river? An aquifer (an underground source of water)? Do they distill salt water from the sea? How close is this water supply to running out (for instance, where I live, the aquifer will eventually run out)?</li>
<li>How polluted is the water? Is it safe to drink? What lives in it? How do they clean it?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transportation
<ul>
<li>What do people use for transportation? Cars? Trains? Horses/other four-legged hooved things? Motorcycles? Trucks? Carriages? Look up what your particular transportation method requires in terms of energy/electricity, and make sure it makes sense with your technology level. Societies also generally utilize more than one kind of transporation, especially in cities.</li>
<li>How is their public transportation? The more crowded/compact the area, the more likely public transportation is going to be widely used. Rural, spaced-out areas tend to depend on cars, trucks, and occasionally long-distance trains.</li>
<li>How is their transportation powered? Most things run on fossil fuels these days, but there are electric cars, trains that are powered by electromagnets, etc. The first trains that developed came around before electricity and ran on steam power.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Information
<ul>
<li>How do people access their information? Does the internet or something like it exist? Other ways of sharing information include books, phones, radio, word of mouth, songs, etc.</li>
<li>How easy is it to learn about things? The lower the level of technology, the harder it is for everyone to access information (for instance, the internet makes this very easy).</li>
<li>How accurate is the information people are able to access? Since the rise of the internet, a lot of complete nonsense is very easy to find via a google search. People also might only be exposed to biased propaganda in their media, and that might be the only thing they know.</li>
<li>How does society view truth? Do they take the things they know as absolute dogma, or do they constantly question things and try to learn more?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Communication
<ul>
<li>How do people communicate? By mail? Phone? Fax? Radio? Telegraph? Internet? In person?</li>
<li>How fast is communication? This depends on the technology in question (obviously the Pony Express is not going to be as quick as a phone). Also, if an area is more spaced out, it will be more difficult for them to establish communications before electricity is invented.</li>
<li>How private are communications? Does the government listen in? Do other people? Who are those people? Can the communications technology be easily hacked? Are there ways for people to protect themselves?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Recreation
<ul>
<li>What kind of technology exists for people to have fun with? Things like amusement parks, hobbies, etc.</li>
<li>What do people do for fun? Obviously, the lower the technology, the simpler it will be.</li>
<li>Is investing in recreation technology a big part of the economy (in most countries, it definitely is. People like to be entertained)?</li>
<li>How dangerous is the technology? A thrill ride built in 2013 is likely to be safer than one built fifty years ago.</li>
<li>What are some of the more dangerous/stupid things people do for fun?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Manufacturing
<ul>
<li>How do people make things? Are they mass-produced in assembly lines? Made by hand?</li>
<li>Who works in the factories, if they exist? Are they people, or are they robots? How does this affect the employment rate?</li>
<li>How dangerous are manufacturing jobs? Robots may eliminate jobs for people, but those jobs might also have been dangerous in the first place. Jobs at the beginning of the industrial revolution were especially dangerous, especially since workers‚Äô rights hadn‚Äôt been as well established back then.</li>
<li>How much pollution does this technology produce? Generally, when things are mass-produced in factories, a lot of waste gets created. Factories are dirty places, and although they‚Äôve definitely improved over the years, they aren‚Äôt exactly green.</li>

<li><strong>Sleepyhead Rule</strong> - The teenaged male lead will begin the first day of the game by oversleeping, being woken up by his mother, and being reminded that he‚Äôs slept in so late he missed meeting his girlfriend.</li>
<li><strong>‚ÄúNo! My beloved peasant village!‚Äù</strong> - The hero‚Äôs home town, city, slum, or planet will usually be annihilated in a spectacular fashion before the end of the game, and often before the end of the opening scene.</li>
<li><strong>Thinking With The Wrong Head (Hiro Rule)</strong> - No matter what she‚Äôs accused of doing or how mysterious her origins are, the hero will always be ready to fight to the death for any girl he met three seconds ago.</li>
<li><strong>Cubic Zirconium Corollary</strong> - The aforementioned mysterious girl will be wearing a pendant that will ultimately prove to be the key to either saving the world or destroying it.</li>
<li><strong>Logan‚Äôs Run Rule</strong> - RPG characters are young. Very young. The average age seems to be 15, unless the character is a decorated and battle-hardened soldier, in which case he might even be as old as 18. Such teenagers often have skills with multiple weapons and magic, years of experience, and never ever worry about their parents telling them to come home from adventuring before bedtime. By contrast, characters more than twenty-two years old will cheerfully refer to themselves as washed-up old fogies and be eager to make room for the younger generation.</li>
<li><strong>Single Parent Rule</strong> - RPG characters with two living parents are almost unheard of. As a general rule, male characters will only have a mother, and female characters will only have a father. The missing parent either vanished mysteriously and traumatically several years ago or is never referred to at all. Frequently the main character‚Äôs surviving parent will also meet an awkward end just after the story begins, thus freeing him of inconvenient filial obligations.</li>
<li><strong>Some Call Me‚Ä¶ Tim?</strong> - Good guys will only have first names, and bad guys will only have last names.

<li><strong>Luddite Rule (or, George Lucas Rule)</strong> - Speaking of which, technology is inherently evil and is the exclusive province of the Bad Guys. They‚Äôre the ones with the robots, factories, cyberpunk megalopolises and floating battle stations, while the Good Guys live in small villages in peaceful harmony with nature. (Although somehow your guns and/or heavily armed airships are exempted from this.)</li>
<li><strong>Let‚Äôs Start From The Very Beginning (Yuna Rule)</strong> - Whenever there is a sequel to an RPG that features the same main character as the previous game, that character will always start with beginner skills. Everything that they learned in the previous game will be gone, as will all their ultra-powerful weapons and equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Poor Little Rich Hero (Meis Rule)</strong> - If the hero comes from a rich and powerful family, it will have fallen on hard times and be broke and destitute by the time the game actually starts.</li>
<li><strong>The Higher The Hair, The Closer To God (Cloud Rule)</strong> - The more outrageous his hairstyle, the more important a male character is to the story.</li>
<li><strong>Garrett‚Äôs Principle</strong> - Let‚Äôs not mince words: you‚Äôre a thief. You can walk into just about anybody‚Äôs house like the door wasn‚Äôt even locked. You just barge right in and start looking for stuff. Anything you can find that‚Äôs not nailed down is yours to keep. You will often walk into perfect strangers‚Äô houses, lift their precious artifacts, and then chat with them like you were old neighbors as you head back out with their family heirlooms under your arm. Unfortunately, this never works in stores.</li>
<li><strong>Hey, I Know You!</strong> - You will accumulate at least three of these obligatory party members:
<ol type="1">
<li>The spunky princess who is rebelling against her royal parent and is in love with the hero.</li>
<li>The demure, soft-spoken female mage and healing magic specialist who is not only in love with the hero, but is also the last survivor of an ancient race.</li>
<li>The tough-as-nails female warrior who is not in love with the hero (note that this is the only female character in the game who is not in love with the hero and will therefore be indicated as such by having a spectacular scar, a missing eye, cyborg limbs or some other physical deformity ‚Äì see The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly Rule.)</li>
<li>The achingly beautiful gothy swordsman who is riven by inner tragedy.</li>
<li>The big, tough, angry guy who, deep down, is a total softy.</li>
<li>The hero‚Äôs best friend, who is actually much cooler than the hero.</li>
<li>The grim, selfish mercenary who over the course of the game learns what it means to really care about other people.</li>
<li>The character who is actually a spy for the bad guys but will instantly switch to your side when you find out about it.</li>
<li>The weird bonus character who requires a bizarre series of side quests to make them effective (with the ultimate result that no player ever uses this character if it can be avoided.)</li>
<li>The nauseatingly cute mascot who is useless in all battles.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Hey, I Know You, Too!</strong> - You will also confront/be confronted by at least three of these obligatory antagonists:
<ol type="1">
<li>The amazingly good-looking and amazingly evil long-haired prettyboy who may or may not be the ultimate villain.</li>
<li>The villain‚Äôs loyal right-hand man, who comes in two versions: humorously incompetent or annoyingly persistent.</li>
<li>The villain‚Äôs attractive female henchman, who is the strongest and most competent soldier in the army but always lets the party escape because she‚Äôs, yes, fallen in love with the hero.</li>
<li>Your former ally who supposedly ‚Äúdied‚Äù and was forgotten about, until much later in the game when he/she shows up again on the villain‚Äôs side and full of bitterness.</li>
<li>The irritatingly honorable foe whom you never get to kill because, upon discovering the true nature of his superiors, he either nobly sacrifices himself or joins your party.</li>
<li>The insane clown or jester who will turn out to be surprisingly difficult to subdue.</li>
<li>The mad scientist who likes creating mutated creatures and powerful weapons ‚Äôcause it‚Äôs fun (and also handy if uninvited adventurers show up.)</li>
<li>The adorably cute li‚Äôl creature or six year old child who fights you and, inexplicably, kicks your butt time after time.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Hey, I Know You, Three!</strong> - Furthermore, expect to encounter most of the following obligatory non-player chararcters (NPCs):
<ol type="1">
<li>The townsperson or crewmember who wanders aimlessly in circles and never quite gets where he is going.</li>
<li>Hilariously incompetent or cowardly soldiers.</li>
<li>The NPC who has a crush on another NPC and can‚Äôt quite work up the nerve to tell him or her, so instead tells every other person who wanders by about it at great length.</li>
<li>A group of small children playing hide-and-seek.</li>
<li>The wise and noble captain/king/high priest.</li>
<li>The wise and noble captain/king/high priest‚Äôs splutteringly evil second-in-command. Nobody, including the hero, will notice the second‚Äôs constant, crazed scheming until the moment when he betrays everyone to the forces of badness.</li>
<li>The NPC who is obsessed with his completely mundane job and witters on endlessly about how great it is. He‚Äôs so thrilled by it that he wants to share it with everyone he sees, so given a quarter of a chance he‚Äôll make you do his job for him.</li>
<li>The (adult) NPC who has nothing better to do than play kids‚Äô games with passersby.</li>
<li>The group of young women who have formed a scarily obsessive fan club for one of your female party members.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Crono‚Äôs Complaint</strong> - The less the main character talks, the more words are put into his mouth, and therefore the more trouble he gets into through no fault of his own.</li>
<li><strong>‚ÄúSilly Squall, bringing a sword to a gunfight‚Ä¶‚Äù</strong> - No matter what timeframe the game is set in ‚Äì past, present, or future ‚Äì the main hero and his antagonist will both use a sword for a weapon. (Therefore, you can identify your antagonist pretty easily right from the start of the game just by looking for the other guy who uses a sword.) These swords will be far more powerful than any gun and often capable of distance attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Just Nod Your Head And Smile</strong> - And no matter how big that big-ass sword is, you won‚Äôt stand out in a crowd. Nobody ever crosses the street to avoid you or seems to be especially shocked or alarmed when a heavily armed gang bursts into their house during dinner, rummages through their possessions, and demands to know if they‚Äôve seen a black-caped man. People can get used to anything, apparently.</li>
<li><strong>Aeris‚Äôs Corollary</strong> - Just as the main male character will always use a sword or a variant of a sword, the main female character will always use a rod or a staff of some sort.</li>
<li><strong>MacGyver Rule</strong> - Other than for the protagonists, your choice of weapons is not limited to the prosaic guns, clubs, or swords. Given appropriate skills, you can cut a bloody swath across the continent using gloves, combs, umbrellas, megaphones, dictionaries, sketching tablets ‚Äì you name it, you can kill with it. Even better, no matter how surreal your choice of armament, every store you pass will just happen to stock an even better model of it for a very reasonable price. Who else is running around the world killing people with an umbrella?</li>
<li><strong>O Brother, Where Art Thou? (Melfice Rule)</strong> - If the male hero has an older sibling, the sibling will also be male and will turn out to be one of the major villains. If the hero has a younger sibling, the sibling will be female and will be kidnapped and held hostage by the villains.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalism Is A Harsh Mistress</strong> - Once you sell something to a shopkeeper, he instantly sells it to somebody else and you will never see the item again no matter what.</li>
<li><strong>Dimensional Transcendence Principle</strong> - Buildings are much, much larger on the inside than on the outside, and that doesn‚Äôt even count the secret maze of tunnels behind the clock in the basement.</li>
<li><strong>Local Control Rule</strong> - Although the boss monster terrorizing the first city in the game is less powerful than the non-boss monsters that are only casual nuisances to cities later in the game, nobody from the first city ever thinks of hiring a few mercenaries from the later cities to kill the monster.</li>
<li><strong>Nostradamus Rule</strong> - All legends are 100% accurate. All rumors are entirely factual. All prophecies will come true, and not just someday but almost immediately.</li>
<li><strong>IDKFA</strong> - The basic ammunition for any firearms your characters have is either unlimited or very, very easy to obtain. This will apply even if firearms are extremely rare.</li>
<li><strong>Indestructible Weapon Rule</strong> - No matter how many times you use that sword to strike armored targets or fire that gun on full auto mode it will never break, jam or need any form of maintenance unless it is critical to the story that the weapon breaks, jams or needs maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Selective Paralysis</strong> - Your characters must always keep both feet on the ground and will be unable to climb over low rock ledges, railings, chairs, cats, slightly differently-colored ground, or any other trivial objects which may happen to be in their way. Note that this condition will not prevent your characters from jumping from railroad car to railroad car later in the game.</li>
<li><strong>Bed Bed Bed</strong> - A good night‚Äôs sleep will cure all wounds, diseases, and disabilities, up to and including death in battle.</li>
<li><strong>You Can‚Äôt Kill Me, I Quit (Seifer Rule)</strong> - The good guys never seem to get the hang of actually arresting or killing the bad guys. Minor villains are always permitted to go free so they can rest up and menace you again later ‚Äì sometimes five minutes later. Knowing this rule, you can deduce that if you do manage to kill (or force the surrender of) a bad guy, you must be getting near the end of the game.</li>
<li><strong>And Now You Die, Mr.&nbsp;Bond! (Beatrix Rule)</strong> - Fortunately for you, the previous rule also applies in reverse. Rather than kill you when they have you at their mercy, the villains will settle for merely blasting you down to 1 hit point and leaving you in a crumpled heap while they stroll off, laughing. (This is, of course, because they‚Äôre already planning ahead how they‚Äôll manipulate you into doing their bidding later in the game ‚Äì see Way To Go, Serge.)</li>
<li><strong>Zap!</strong> - Most villains in RPGs possess some form of teleportation. They generally use it to materialize in front of the adventurers when they reach the Obligatory Legendary Relic Room and seize the goodies just before you can. The question ‚Äúif the bad guy can teleport anywhere at any time, then why doesn‚Äôt (s)he just zip in, grab the artifact, and leave before the adventurers have even finished the nerve-wracking puzzle on the third floor?‚Äù is never answered.</li>
<li><strong>Heads I Win, Tails You Lose (Grahf Rule)</strong> - It doesn‚Äôt matter that you won the fight with the boss monster; the evil task he was trying to carry out will still get accomplished somehow. Really, you might as well not have bothered.</li>
<li><strong>Clockwork Universe Rule</strong> - No matter how hard you try to stop it, that comet or meteor will always hit the earth.</li>
<li><strong>Fake Ending</strong> - There will be a sequence which pretends to be the end of the game but obviously isn‚Äôt ‚Äì if for no other reason than because you‚Äôre still on Disk 1 of 4.</li>
<li><strong>You Die, And We All Move Up In Rank</strong> - During that fake ending, the true villain of the story will kill the guy you‚Äôd thought was the villain, just to demonstrate what a badass he (the true villain) really is. You never get to kill the fake villain yourself.</li>
<li><strong>‚ÄúWhat are we going to do tonight, Vinsfeld?‚Äù</strong> - The goal of every game (as revealed during the Fake Ending) is to Save the World from an evil figure who‚Äôs trying to take it over or destroy it. There is no way to escape from this formidable task. No matter whether the protagonist‚Äôs goal in life is to pay off a debt, to explore distant lands, or just to make time with that cute girl in the blue dress, it will be necessary for him to Save the World in order to accomplish it. Take heart, though ‚Äì once the world gets sorted out, everything else will fall into place almost immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Zelda‚Äôs Axiom</strong> - Whenever somebody tells you about ‚Äúthe five ancient talismans‚Äù or ‚Äúthe nine legendary crystals‚Äù or whatever, you can be quite confident that Saving the World will require you to go out and find every last one of them.</li>
<li><strong>George W. Bush Geography Simplification Initiative</strong> - Every country in the world will have exactly one town in it, except for the country you start out in, which will have three.</li>
<li><strong>Fodor‚Äôs Guide Rule</strong> - In the course of your adventure you will visit one desert city, one port town, one mining town, one casino city, one magic city (usually flying), one medieval castle kingdom, one clockwork city, one martial arts-based community, one thieves‚Äô slum, one lost city and one sci-fi utopia. On the way you‚Äôll also get a chance to see the cave with rocks that glow from a natural energy source, the village populated with nonhuman characters, the peaceful village where everyone knows the latest news about the hero‚Äôs quest (see Guy in the Street Rule), the snow village, the magical forest/lake/mountain, the shop in the middle of nowhere, the fantastic-looking place with lots of FMVs just showing your entrance, the subtropical jungle island populated by friendly natives, the annoying cavern maze, and a place ‚Äì any place ‚Äì that was destroyed in some past disaster.</li>
<li><strong>Midgar Principle</strong> - The capital of the evil empire is always divided into two sections: a lower city slum filled with slaves and supporters of the rebellion, and an upper city filled with loyal fanatics and corrupt aristocrats.</li>
<li><strong>Not Invented Here</strong> - Trade of technology will not exist. One place in the world will have all the techno-gadgets while all the others will be harvesting dirt.</li>
<li><strong>Law of Cartographical Elegance</strong> - The world map always cleanly fits into a rectangular shape with no land masses that cross an edge.</li>
<li><strong>¬øQuien Es Mas Macho? (Fargo Rule)</strong> - Every powerful character you attempt to seek aid from will first insist upon ‚Äútesting your strength‚Äù in a battle to the death.</li>
<li><strong>We Had To Destroy The Village In Order To, Well, You Know The Rest (Selene Rule)</strong> - No matter what happens, never call on the government, the church, or any other massive controlling authority for help. They‚Äôll just send a brigade of soldiers to burn your entire village to the ground.</li>
<li><strong>Zidane‚Äôs Curse (or, Dirty Pair Rule)</strong> - An unlucky condition in which every major city in the game will coincidentally wind up being destroyed just after the hero arrives.</li>
<li><strong>Maginot Line Rule</strong> - It is easy to tell which city/nation is the next conquest of the Evil Empire: its streets are filled with citizens who brag that the Empire would never dare attack them, and would be easily defeated if it tried. (This smug nationalism always fails to take into account the Empire‚Äôs new superweapon.)</li>
<li><strong>Short Attention Span Principle</strong> - All bookshelves contain exactly one book, which only has enough text on it to fill up half a page.</li>
<li><strong>Planet of the Apes Rule</strong> - All cities and countries have ancestors that were wiped out by their technological advances.</li>
<li><strong>Insomnia Rule</strong> - A ‚Äúfree stay at the inn‚Äù is never really free. Expect to be woken up in the middle of the night for a mandatory plot event.</li>
<li><strong>The Bling-Bling Thing (Lemina Rule)</strong> - No matter how much money and treasure you acquire, the greedy member of your party will never be satisfied and won‚Äôt stop griping about the sorry state of the party‚Äôs finances.</li>
<li><strong>I Don‚Äôt Like Gears Or Fighting</strong> - There are always giant robots. Always.</li>
<li><strong>Houdini‚Äôs Postulate</strong> - Anyone, whether they are in the player‚Äôs party or not, who is placed in any kind of prison, fortress, cell, or detention block will escape immediately. Party members will be freed either by a small child they just happened to befriend earlier in the day or by an unexpected disaster that overcomes the enemy base, NPCs will be freed by the released party members, and villains will break out all by themselves because they‚Äôre such badasses. Once a person has escaped from jail, no attempt will be made by the police to recapture them in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Zeigfried‚Äôs Contradiction</strong> - Just because someone is weird doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre important.</li>
<li><strong>Natural Monopoly Rule</strong> - No city will have more than two shops, unless it is crucial to the story that there be a hundred vendors which you must visit in order (see You Always Travel In The Right Circles.) All of these shops will sell the same goods for the same price.</li>
<li><strong>But They Don‚Äôt Take American Express</strong> - Every merchant in the world ‚Äì even those living in far-off villages or hidden floating cities cut off from the outside world for centuries, even those who speak different languages or are of an entirely different species ‚Äì accepts the same currency.</li>
<li><strong>Apathy Principle</strong> - Your group is the only bunch of people trying to save the world. All other would-be heroes will either join your party or else turn out to be cowards and/or con men.</li>
<li><strong>The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly Rule</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li>Any male character who is ugly, malformed, or misshapen is either evil or so moral, spiritual, and/or wise that it‚Äôs a wonder no one‚Äôs proposed him for sainthood yet.</li>
<li>Any male character who has a physical dysfiguration that doesn‚Äôt seem to impede him (i.e.&nbsp;a prominent scar across the face or a bad eye) is evil, unless he is the male lead, since scars are cool and no other good guy can be as cool as the hero. An exception is made for characters who are clearly ancient, and therefore automatically not as cool as the young hero.</li>
<li>Any female character who is ugly, malformed, misshapen, or physically disfigured is evil, since all good female characters are there to be potentially seduced by the male lead ‚Äì see Know Your Audience.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<!-- -->
<ol start="61" type="1">
<li><strong>Henchman Quota (Nana, Saki, and Mio Rule)</strong> - One of your antagonists will have three lovably incompetent stooges whom you fight over and over again. Although they‚Äôre trusted with their boss‚Äôs most important plans and equipment, they will screw up repeatedly, argue incessantly among themselves, blab secret information, and generally only come out victorious when their job was to be a diversion or a delaying tactic. A high point of the game will come when the True Villain reveals himself and you‚Äôre able to convince the stooges you‚Äôre all on the same side. They won‚Äôt help you out any more successfully than they helped the antagonist, but at least you won‚Äôt have to fight them any more.</li>
<li><strong>Thousand Year Rule</strong> - The Ancient Evil returns to savage the land every thousand years on the dot, and the last time it showed up was just about 999.9875 years ago. Despite their best efforts, heroes of the past were never able to do more than seal the Evil away again for the future to deal with (which brings up the question of just how exactly does this ‚Äúsealing away‚Äù work anyway, but never mind.) The good news is that this time, the Evil will get destroyed permanently. The bad news is that you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs going to have to do it.</li>
<li><strong>Principle of Narrative Efficiency</strong> - If the main villain (or the enemy you‚Äôve been trying to kill for most of the game before he summons the real final villain) was ever defeated in the past by another group of adventurers, one of them will secretly be in your party and one of them will be the hero‚Äôs father.</li>
<li><strong>Ayn Rand‚Äôs Revenge</strong> - Outside the major cities, there is no government whatsoever. Of course, perhaps that explains why it‚Äôs so difficult and dangerous to get anywhere outside the major cities.</li>
<li><strong>First Law of Travel</strong> - Anything can become a vehicle ‚Äì castles, cities, military academies, you name it ‚Äì so do not be alarmed when the stones of the ancient fortress you are visiting shake underfoot and the whole thing lifts off into the sky. As a corollary, anything is capable of flight if it would be cool, aeronautics or even basic physics be damned.</li>
<li><strong>Second Law of Travel</strong> - There will be only one of any non-trivial type of vehicle in the entire world. Thus, only one ocean-capable steamboat, only one airship, and so forth. Massive facilities will have been constructed all over the world to service this one vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Third Law of Travel</strong> - The only way to travel by land between different areas of a continent will always be through a single narrow pass in a range of otherwise impenetrable mountains. Usually a palace or monastery will have been constructed in the pass, entirely filling it, so that all intracontinental traffic is apparently required to abandon their vehicles and go on foot up stairs and through the barracks, library and throne room to get to the other side. This may explain why most people just stay home. (In some cases a cave or underground tunnel may be substituted for the palace or monastery, but it will still be just as inconvenient with the added bonuses of cave-ins and nonsensical elevator puzzles.)</li>
<li><strong>Fourth Law of Travel</strong> - Three out of every four vehicles you ride on will eventually sink, derail or crash in some spectacular manner.</li>
<li><strong>Fifth Law of Travel</strong> - All vehicles can be driven or piloted by anyone. The main character just needs to find out where the bridge or steering wheel is, as he already knows all of the controls.</li>
<li><strong>Sixth Law of Travel</strong> - Nobody gets to own a cooler ride than you. If you ever do see a cooler vehicle than the one you‚Äôve got now, at some point before the end of the game you will either take over this vehicle, get something even bigger and better, or else see it destroyed in a glorious blaze.</li>
<li><strong>Seventh Law of Travel</strong> - When on a voyage to another continent, the journey will last only as long as it takes you to talk to all the other passengers and the captain.</li>
<li><strong>Eighth Law of Travel</strong> - There are no shortcuts, ever ‚Äì unless you are forced to take them, in which case they will be much longer and more dangerous than your original route.</li>
<li><strong>Last Law of Travel (Big Joe Rule)</strong> - As has been described, you must endure great trials just to get from town to town: locating different vehicles, operating ancient transport mechanisms, evading military blockades, the list goes on. But that‚Äôs just you. Every other character in the game seems to have no trouble getting to any place in the world on a moment‚Äôs notice.</li>
<li><strong>If You Meet The Buddha In A Random Encounter, Kill Him!</strong> - When you‚Äôre out wandering around the world, you must kill everything you meet. People, animals, plants, insects, fire hydrants, small cottages, anything and everything is just plain out to get you. It may be because of your rampant kleptomania (see Garrett‚Äôs Principle.)</li>
<li><strong>Law of Numbers</strong> - There will be several items or effects which depend on the numerical value of your hit points, level, etc., which makes no sense unless the characters can see all the numbers in their world and find it perfectly normal that a spell only works on a monster whose level is a multiple of 5.</li>
<li><strong>Magical Inequality Theorem</strong> - In the course of your travels you may find useful-sounding spells such as Petrify, Silence, and Instant Death. However, you will end up never using these spells in combat because a) all ordinary enemies can be killed with a few normal attacks, making fancy attacks unneccessary, b) all bosses and other stronger-than-average monsters are immune to those effects so there‚Äôs no point in using them for long fights where they‚Äôd actually come in handy, and c) the spells usually don‚Äôt work anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Magical Inequality Corollary</strong> - When the enemy uses Petrify, Silence, Instant Death, et cetera spells on you, they will be effective 100% of the time.</li>
<li><strong>Pretty Line Syndrome (or, Crash Bandicoot: The RPG)</strong> -Seen in most modern RPGs. The key to completing your quest is to walk forward in a straight line for fifty hours, stopping along the way to look at, kill, and/or have meaningful conversations with various pretty things.</li>
<li><strong>Xenobiology Rule</strong> - The predatory species of the world will include representatives of all of the following: giant spiders, giant scorpions, giant snakes, giant beetles, wolves, squid, fish that float in midair, gargoyles, golems, carnivorous plants, chimeras, griffons, cockatrices, hydras, minotaurs, burrowing things with big claws, things that can paralyze you, things that can put you to sleep, things that can petrify you, at least twenty different creatures with poisonous tentacles, and dragons. Always dragons.</li>
<li><strong>Friendly Fire Principle (or, Final Fantasy Tactics Rule)</strong> - Any attack that can target both allies and enemies will hit half of your allies and none of your enemies.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon Design 101</strong> - There‚Äôs always goodies hidden behind the waterfall.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon Design 102</strong> - When you are confronted by two doors, the closer one will be locked and its key will be hidden behind the farther-away one.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon Design 103 (or, Wallpaper Warning)</strong> - Your progress through a dungeon will be indicated by a sudden change in decor: different wall color, different torches on the wall, et cetera.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon Design 201 (or, The Interior Decorators Anticipated Your Out-Of-Body Experience)</strong> - Most dungeons will include ‚Äúhidden‚Äù passages which are nearly impossible to see from a bird‚Äôs-eye view, yet would be blaringly obvious from the party‚Äôs perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon Design 301</strong> - All ‚Äúpuzzles‚Äù in RPG dungeons can be sorted into one of the following types:
<ol start="61" type="1">
<li>finding some small item and sticking it into a slot;</li>
<li>pushing blocks (rocks, statues) onto switches;</li>
<li>pulling switches or levers to open and close doors;</li>
<li>learning the correct order/position of a group of objects;</li>
<li>entering a certain combination of doors;</li>
<li>something involving a clock or elevator;</li>
<li>something that is unsolvable because a vital clue in the dialogue was mistranslated out of Japanese.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Wait! That Was A Load-Bearing Boss!</strong> - Defeating a dungeon‚Äôs boss creature will frequently cause the dungeon to collapse, which is nonsensical but does make for thrilling escape scenes.</li>
<li><strong>Supply and Demand Axiom</strong> - Killing a powerful enemy will usually yield an item or weapon that would‚Äôve been extremely useful if you had gotten it before killing that enemy.</li>
<li><strong>Edison‚Äôs Lament</strong> - No switch is ever in the right position.</li>
<li><strong>Well, That About Wraps It Up For God</strong> - All major deities, assuming they actually exist and weren‚Äôt just made up by the Church to delude its followers, are in reality malevolent and will have to be destroyed. The only exception to this rule is the four nature spirits who have preserved the land since time immemorial, but now due to the folly of mankind have lost virtually all of their power and need you to accomplish some ludicrous task to save them.</li>
<li><strong>Guy in the Street Rule</strong> - No matter how fast you travel, rumors of world events always travel faster. When you get to anywhere, the people on the street are already talking about where you‚Äôve been. The stories of your past experiences will spread even if no witnesses were around to see them.</li>
<li><strong>Wherever You Go, There They Are</strong> - Wherever the characters go, the villains can always find them. Chances are they‚Äôre asking the guy in the street (see above). But don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì despite being able to find the characters with ease anytime they want to, the bad guys never get rid of them by simply blowing up the tent or hotel they‚Äôre spending the night in. (Just think of it: the screen dims, the peaceful going-to-sleep-now music plays, then BOOM! Game Over!)</li>
<li><strong>Figurehead Rule</strong> - Whenever someone asks you a question to decide what to do, it‚Äôs just to be polite. He or she will ask the question again and again until you answer ‚Äúcorrectly.‚Äù</li>
<li><strong>Puddin‚Äô Tame Rule</strong> - The average passer-by will always say the same thing no matter how many times you talk to them, and they certainly won‚Äôt clarify any of the vaguely worded warnings or cryptic half-sentences they threw at you the previous time.</li>
<li><strong>Franklin Covey Was Wrong, Wrong, Wrong</strong> - Sticking to the task at hand and going directly from place to place and goal to goal is always a bad idea, and may even prevent you from being able to finish the game. It‚Äôs by dawdling around, completing side quests and giving money to derelicts that you come into your real power.</li>
<li><strong>Selective Invulnerability Principle</strong> - RPG characters are immune from such mundane hazards as intense heat, freezing cold, or poison gas‚Ä¶ except when they‚Äôre suddenly not. Surprise!</li>
<li><strong>I‚Äôm the NRA (Billy Lee Black Rule)</strong> - Opposition to gun control is probably the only thing you could get all RPG characters to agree upon. Even deep religious faith and heartfelt pacifism can‚Äôt compete with the allure of guns.</li>
<li><strong>Three Females Rule</strong> - There will always be either one or three female characters in the hero‚Äôs party, no matter how many male characters there are.</li>
<li><strong>Experience Not Required</strong> - When the main character is forced to do some complex or dangerous task for the first time, even though he has never done it before he will still always be better than the oldest veteran.</li>
<li><strong>Law of Reverse Evolution (Zeboim Principle)</strong> - Any ancient civilizations are inexplicably much more advanced than the current one.</li>
<li><strong>Science-Magic Equivalence (Citan Rule)</strong> - Although mages‚Äô specialty is magic and scientists‚Äô specialty is technology, these skills are completely interchangeable.</li>
<li><strong>Law of Productive Gullibility (Ruby Rule)</strong> - Whenever anybody comes up to you with a patently ludicrous claim (such as, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a cat, I‚Äôm really an ancient Red Dragon‚Äù) there‚Äôs an at least two-thirds chance they‚Äôre telling the truth. Therefore, it pays to humor everyone you meet; odds are you‚Äôll be glad you did later on.</li>
<li><strong>Perversity Principle</strong> - If you‚Äôre unsure about what to do next, ask all the townspeople nearby. They will either all strongly urge you to do something, in which case you must immediately go out and do that thing, or else they will all strongly warn you against doing something, in which case you must immediately go out and do that thing.</li>
<li><strong>Near-Death Epiphany (Fei Rule)</strong> - If the party is not dealing damage to a boss character, then there‚Äôs a better-than-even chance that someone in the party will suddenly become enlightened and instantly acquire the offensive skill that can blow the creature away in a matter of seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Wutai Rule</strong> - Most RPGs, no matter what their mythology, include a land based on ancient Japan. Full of pagodas, shrines, shoguns, kitsune, and sushi, this completely anachronistic place is the source of the entire world‚Äôs supply of ninja and samurai characters.</li>
<li><strong>Law of Mooks</strong> - Soldiers and guards working for the Evil Empire are, as a rule, sloppy, cowardly and incompetent. Members of the heroic Resistance Faction are, as a rule, dreadfully weak and undertrained and will be wiped out to the last man the moment they come in contact with the enemy.</li>
<li><strong>Law of Traps</strong> - No matter how obvious the trap, you can‚Äôt complete the game unless you fall into it.</li>
<li><strong>Arbor Day Rule</strong> - At some point, you‚Äôre going to have to talk to a tree and do what it says.</li>
<li><strong>You Do Not Talk About Fight Club</strong> - Any fighting tournament or contest of skill you hear about, you will eventually be forced to enter and win.</li>
<li><strong>Invisible Bureaucracy Rule</strong> - Other than the royal family, its shifty advisor, and the odd mad scientist, the only government employees you will ever encounter in the course of your adventure are either guards or kitchen staff.</li>
<li><strong>The Miracle of Automation</strong> - Similarly, any factory, power plant, or other facility that you visit during the course of the game will be devoid of any human life except for the occasional guards. There will not be a single line worker or maintenance person in sight.</li>
<li><strong>Principle of Archaeological Convenience</strong> - Every ancient machine you find will work perfectly the first time you try to use it and every time thereafter. Even if its city got blasted into ruins and the machine was then sunk to the bottom of the sea and buried in mud for ten thousand years, it‚Äôll still work fine. The unfortunate corollary to this rule is that ancient guardian creatures will also turn out to be working perfectly when you try to filch their stuff.</li>
<li><strong>They Don‚Äôt Make ‚ÄôEm Like They Used To (Cid Rule)</strong> - Modern-day machinery, by contrast, will always break down at the worst possible moment (for example, when you only need one more shot from the giant cannon to defeat the final boss.)</li>
<li><strong>Place Transvestite Joke Here (Miss Cloud Rule)</strong> - If the male lead is required to dress up like a girl for any reason, he will be regarded by everyone as much more attractive than any ‚Äúreal‚Äù girl. If the female lead cross-dresses as a man, she will be immediately recognized as who she is by everyone except the male lead and the main villain.</li>
<li><strong>Make Room! Make Room!</strong> - There are always more people in a town or village than there are houses for them to live in. Most of the village is made up of shops, temples, bars, secret passages, inns, and the mansion that belongs to the richest man in town.</li>
<li><strong>Law of Scientific Gratification</strong> - If the hero needs a new invention to progress, he will find out that somewhere in the world someone has spent his or her entire life perfecting this invention, and usually just needs one more key item located in a monster-infested dungeon before it is completed.</li>
<li><strong>You Always Travel In The Right Circles</strong> - Whenever you meet a villager or other such incidental character who promises to give you some great piece of needed knowledge or a required object in exchange for a seemingly simple item, such as a bar of soap or a nice straw mat, be prepared to spend at least an hour chasing around the world exchanging useless innocuous item after item with bizarre strangers until you can get that elusive first item you were asked for.</li>
<li><strong>Talk Is Cheap Rule</strong> - Nothing is ever solved by diplomacy or politics in the world of RPGs. Any declarations of peace, summits and treaty negotiations are traps to fool the ever so gullible Good Guys into thinking the war is over, or to brainwash the remaining leaders of the world.</li>
<li><strong>Stop Your Life (Setzer Rule)</strong> - No matter what kind of exciting, dynamic life a character was leading before joining your party, once there they will be perfectly content to sit and wait on the airship until you choose to use them.</li>
<li><strong>Don‚Äôt Stand Out</strong> - Any townsperson who is dressed oddly or otherwise doesn‚Äôt fit in with the rest of the townsfolk will either: 1. Join your party after you complete some task, 2. Be in the employ of your enemy, or 3. Befriend any female member of the party, and then be immediately captured and held hostage by the villains.</li>
<li><strong>Little Nemo Law</strong> - If any sleeping character has a dream, that dream will be either a 100% accurate memory of the past, a 100% accurate psychic sending from the present, a 100% accurate prophetic vision of the future, or a combination of two or all three of these.</li>
<li><strong>Child Protection Act (Rydia Rule)</strong> - Children 12 and under are exempt from death. They will emerge alive from cataclysms that slaughter hundreds of sturdily-built adults, often with barely a scratch. Further protection is afforded if the catastrophe will orphan the child.</li>
<li><strong>Missing Master Hypothesis</strong> - Almost every strong physical fighter learned everything he/she knows from some old master or friend. Invariably, the master or friend has since turned evil, been killed, or disappeared without a trace.</li>
<li><strong>Missing Master Corollary (Sabin Rule)</strong> - If a fighter‚Äôs master merely disappeared, you will undoubtedly find him/her at some point in your travels. The master will challenge the student to a duel, after which the student will be taught one final skill that the master had been holding back for years.</li>
<li><strong>Gojira Axiom</strong> - Giant monsters capable of leveling cities all have the following traits:
<ol start="61" type="1">
<li>Low intelligence</li>
<li>Enormous strength</li>
<li>Projectile attacks</li>
<li>Gigantic teeth and claws, designed, presumably, to eat other giant monsters</li>
<li>Vulnerable to weapons 1/10,000th its size</li>
<li>Ecologically sensitive</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>‚ÄúYou Couldn‚Äôt Get To Sleep Either, Huh?‚Äù</strong> - If any character in the game ever meets any other character standing alone at night looking at the moon, those two will eventually fall in love.</li>
<li><strong>Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely (Althena Rule)</strong> - If a good guy is manipulated to the side of evil, they will suddenly find a new inner strength that will enable them to wipe out your whole party with a wave of their hand.</li>
<li><strong>All Is Forgiven (Nash Rule)</strong> - However, when the trusted member of your party turns against you, do not give it a second thought. They will return to your side after they‚Äôre done with their amnesia/mind control/hidden noble goal that caused them to give away all your omnipotent mystical artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>First Law of Fashion</strong> - All characters wear a single costume which does not change over the course of the game. The only exception is when characters dress up in enemy uniforms to infiltrate their base.</li>
<li><strong>Second Law of Fashion</strong> - Any character‚Äôs costume, no matter how skimpy, complicated, or simply outlandish, is always completely suitable to wear when climbing around in caves, hiking across the desert, and slogging through the sewers. It will continue to be completely suitable right afterwards when said character goes to meet the King.</li>
<li><strong>Third Law of Fashion</strong> - In any futuristic setting, the standard uniform for female soldiers and special agents will include a miniskirt and thigh-high stockings. The standard uniform for all male characters, military or not, will include an extraordinarily silly and enormous hat.</li>
<li><strong>First Rule of Politics (Chancellor‚Äôs Axiom)</strong> - Any advisor of a major ruler has been scheming after his throne for quite a while. Thanks to the miracle of timing, you will arrive at the king‚Äôs inner sanctum just in time for the coup.</li>
<li><strong>Second Rule of Politics (Scapegoat‚Äôs Axiom)</strong> - If the advisor works for an evil ruler, the advisor is as bad or even worse, and there‚Äôs a good chance he‚Äôs the final villain. (See Fake Ending Rule.) If the advisor works for a good ruler, he usually has the good of the kingdom at heart; not that that helps, because your party will invariably be made the scapegoat for all that‚Äôs wrong with the nation and immediately thrown in the dungeon.</li>
<li><strong>Last Rule of Politics</strong> - Kingdoms are good. Empires are evil.</li>
<li><strong>Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics (Ramus Rule)</strong> - Twenty-three generations may pass, but any person‚Äôs direct descendant will still look and act just like him.</li>
<li><strong>Pinch Hitter Rule</strong> - Whenever a member of the hero‚Äôs team is killed or retires, no matter how unique or special he or she was there is a good chance someone will show up to replace them that has exactly the same abilities and can use the same weapons with the same proficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Dealing With Beautiful Women, Part 1 (Yuffie Rule)</strong> - All good-looking young females are there to help you. This rule holds even when the girl in question is annoying, useless, or clearly evil.</li>
<li><strong>Dealing With Beautiful Women, Part 2 (Rouge Rule)</strong> - All good-looking middle-aged females are out to kill you. This rule holds even when the woman in question has attained your unwavering trust and respect.</li>
<li><strong>Well, So Much For That</strong> - After you have completed your mighty quest to find the object that will save the known universe, it will either a) get lost, b) get stolen, or c) not work.</li>
<li><strong>The Ominous Ring of Land</strong> - The classic Ominous Ring of Land is a popular terrain feature that frequently doesn‚Äôt show up on your world map. Just when you think things are going really well and you‚Äôve got the Forces of Evil on the run, monsters, demons and mad gods will pour out of the center of the ring and the situation will get ten times worse. The main villain also usually hangs out in one of these after attaining godhood. If there are several Ominous Rings of Land or the entire world map is one big ring, you are just screwed.</li>
<li><strong>Law of NPC Relativity (Magus Rule)</strong> - Characters can accomplish superhuman physical feats, defeat enemies with one hand tied behind their back and use incredible abilities ‚Äì until they join your party and you can control them. Then these wonderful powers all vanish, along with most of their hit points.</li>
<li><strong>Guards! Guards! (or, Lindblum Full Employment Act)</strong> - Everything will be guarded and gated (elevators, docks, old rickety bridges, random stretches of roadway deep in the forest) except for the stuff that actually needs to be.</li>
<li><strong>Thank You For Pressing The Self-Destruct Button</strong> - All enemy installations and city-sized military vehicles will be equipped with a conveniently located, easy-to-operate self-destruct mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Falling Rule</strong> - An RPG character can fall any distance onto anything without suffering anything worse than brief unconsciousness. In fact, falling a huge distance is an excellent cure for otherwise fatal wounds ‚Äì anyone who you see shot, stabbed, or mangled and then tossed off a cliff is guaranteed to return later in the game with barely a scratch.</li>
<li><strong>Materials Science 101</strong> - Gold, silver, and other precious metals make excellent weapons and armor even though in the real world they are too soft and heavy to use for that purpose. In fact, they work so well that nobody ever melts their solid gold suit of armor down into bullion, sells it, and retires to a tropical isle on the proceeds.</li>
<li><strong>Materials Science 201</strong> - Everyone you meet will talk enthusiastically about how some fantastically rare metal (iron, say) would make the best possible armor and weapons. Oh, if only you could get your hands on some! However, once you actually obtain iron ‚Äì at great personal risk, of course ‚Äì everyone will dismiss it as yesterday‚Äôs news and instead start talking about some even more fantastically rare metal, such as gold. Repeat until you get to the metal after ‚Äúmythril‚Äù (see The Ultimate Rule.)</li>
<li><strong>Seventh Inning Stretch (Elc Rule)</strong> - At some point in the game the main hero will receive a deadly story-driven injury and will be put in a hospital instead of having a mage heal him. This will leave him out of commission for at least the length of two sidequests; the female lead will also be temporarily out of commission as she steadfastly refuses to leave the hero‚Äôs side. Ultimately a simple vision quest is all that will be required to bring the hero back to normal.</li>
<li><strong>Vivi‚Äôs Spellbook Principle</strong> - Over the course of the game, you will spend countless hours learning between twenty and one hundred skills and/or spells, approximately three of which will still be useful by the end of the game.</li>
<li><strong>Gender Equality, Part 1 (Feena Rule)</strong> - Your average female RPG character carries a variety of deadly weapons and can effortlessly hack or magic her way through armies of monsters, killer cyborgs, and mutated boss creatures without breaking a sweat. She may be an accomplished ninja, a superpowered secret agent, or the world‚Äôs greatest adventurer. However, if one of the game‚Äôs villains manages to sneak up and grab her by the Standard Female Character Grab Area (her upper arm) she will be rendered utterly helpless until rescued by the hero.</li>
<li><strong>Gender Equality, Part 2 (Tifa Rule)</strong> - If any female character, in a burst of anger or enthusiasm, decides to go off and accomplish something on her own without the hero, she will fail miserably and again have to be rescued.</li>
<li><strong>Gender Equality, Part 3 (Luna Rule)</strong> - All of the effort you put into maxing out the female lead‚Äôs statistics and special abilities will turn out to be for naught when she spends the final confrontation with the villain dead, ensorcelled, or held hostage.</li>
<li><strong>Gender Equality Addendum (Rynn Rule)</strong> - In the unlikely event that the main character of the game is female, she will not be involved in any romantic subplot whatsoever beyond getting hit on by shopkeepers.</li>
<li><strong>Stealing The Spotlight (Edea Rule)</strong> - The characters who join your party only briefly tend to be much cooler than your regular party members.</li>
<li><strong>‚ÄúMommy, why didn‚Äôt they just use a Phoenix Down on Aeris?‚Äù</strong> - Don‚Äôt expect battle mechanics to carry over into the ‚Äúreal world.‚Äù</li>
<li><strong>Gold Saucer Rule</strong> - The strongest weapons/items/spells in the entire game can only be found by doing things like racing birds.</li>
<li><strong>Evil May Live Forever, But It Doesn‚Äôt Age Well</strong> - Even though it took the greatest armies in the world and all of the world‚Äôs greatest magicians to seal away an ancient evil in an apocalyptic war, once said ancient evil breaks free three fairly inexperienced warriors can destroy it.</li>
<li><strong>Sephiroth Memorial Escape Clause</strong> - Any misdeed up to and including multiple genocide is forgiveable if you‚Äôre cool enough.</li>
<li><strong>Doomed Utopia Theorem (Law of Zeal)</strong> - All seemingly ideal, utopian societies are powered by some dark force and are therefore doomed to swift, flashy destruction.</li>
<li><strong>Party Guidance Rule</strong> - Somewhere in the last third of the story, the hero will make a stupid decision and the rest of the party must remind him of all that they have learned from being with him in order to return the hero to normal.</li>
<li><strong>Bad Is Good, Baby!</strong> - The heroes can always count on the support of good-hearted vampires, dragons, thieves, demons, and chainsaw murderers in their quest to save the world from evil. And on the other hand‚Ä¶</li>
<li><strong>Good Is Bad, Baby!</strong> - Watch out for generous priests, loyal military officers, and basically anyone in a position of authority who agrees to help you out, especially if they save your life and prove their sincerity innumerable times ‚Äì they‚Äôre usually plotting your demise in secret (at least when they can fit it into their busy schedule of betraying their country, sponsoring international terrorism, and stealing candy from small children) and will stab you in the back at the most inconvenient moment, unless they fall under‚Ä¶</li>
<li><strong>General Leo‚Äôs Exception</strong> - Honorable and sympathetic people who work for the Other Side are always the genuine article. Of course they‚Äôll be busily stabbing you in the front, so either way you lose. Eventually though, they‚Äôll fall prey to‚Ä¶</li>
<li><strong>The Ineffectual Ex-Villain Theorem (Col. Mullen Rule)</strong> - No matter how tough and bad-ass one of the Other Side‚Äôs henchmen is, if he bails to the side of Good he‚Äôll turn out to be not quite tough and bad-ass enough. The main villain will defeat him easily. But don‚Äôt weep ‚Äì usually he‚Äôll manage to escape just in time, leaving you to deal with the fate that was meant for him.</li>
<li><strong>All The Time In The World (Rinoa Rule)</strong> - Unless there‚Äôs a running countdown clock right there on the screen, you have as long as you want to complete any task ‚Äì such as, say, rescuing a friend who‚Äôs hanging by one hand from a slippery cliff edge thousands of feet in the air ‚Äì no matter how incredibly urgent it is. Dawdle or hurry as you will, you‚Äôll always make it just in the nick of time.</li>
<li><strong>Ladies First (Belleza Rule)</strong> - When things really start falling apart, the villain‚Äôs attractive female henchman will be the first to jump ship and switch to the side of Good. Sadly, she still won‚Äôt survive until the end credits, because later she will sacrifice her life out of unrequited love for the villain.</li>
<li><strong>Trial By Fire (Cecil Rule)</strong> - Any dark and brooding main characters will ultimately be redeemed by a long, ardous, quasi-spiritual quest that seems difficult at the time, but in the great scheme of things just wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal after all.</li>
<li><strong>Key Item Rule</strong> - Never discard, sell, or otherwise remove permamently from your possession any items you begin the game with or acquire within the first town. This is especially true for items that seem to have no practical use, because of‚Ä¶</li>
<li><strong>The Law of Inverse Practicality (Key Item Corollary)</strong> - Any item that you can acquire will have some sort of purpose. Those that seem to be useless and have no practical value at all, always tend to have great power later on. The earlier you get the item, the later in the game it will be used. The longer the span of time between acquisition and use, the more powerful the item is.</li>
<li><strong>Way To Go, Serge</strong> - It will eventually turn out that, for a minimum of the first sixty percent of the game, you were actually being manipulated by the forces of evil into doing their sinister bidding for them. In extreme cases this may go as high as 90%. The clear implication is that it would have been better to not get involved in the first place.</li>
<li><strong>Gilligan‚Äôs Prescription</strong> - Any character who has amnesia will be cured before the end of the game. They usually won‚Äôt like what they find out about themselves, though.</li>
<li><strong>Luke, I Am Your Tedious, Overused Plot Device (Lynx Rule)</strong> - If there is any chance whatsoever that major villain X could be the male lead‚Äôs father, then it will turn out that major villain X is the male lead‚Äôs father.</li>
<li><strong>World of Mild Inconvenience</strong> - The devastating plague, noxious gas, planet-obliterating meteor or other large-scale disaster that led to the death of millions will affect your party (and your party‚Äôs friends and family members) in no way whatsoever, save that a few party members may become lost and you can find them later.</li>
<li><strong>Golden Chocobo Principle</strong> - There will be at least one supremely ultimate improvement for your weapon or some way to make your trusted steed capable of going anywhere and doing anything, requiring hours and hours of hard work to acquire. Once you do achieve this, you will use it once, and it will be completely useless for the rest of the game.</li>
<li><strong>Golden Chocobo Corollary</strong> - The magic formula for acquiring this supreme upgrade will be only vaguely alluded to in the game itself. Ideally, you‚Äôre supposed to shell out $19.95 for the strategy guide instead.</li>
<li><strong>Flow of Goods Rule</strong> - The quality of goods in the world is dependent upon the shop‚Äôs distance from the final dungeon. It doesn‚Äôt matter if the town you start in has a huge thriving economy and is the center of world trade, it will always have the game‚Äôs worst equipment; and even if that village near the end is isolated and has only three people in it, it will have the game‚Äôs best equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Master Key Rule</strong> - Any and all locked doors that the characters encounter will be unlocked by the end of the game.</li>
<li><strong>‚ÄúEvil will always triumph, because Good is dumb!‚Äù</strong> - If the villain needs all ten legendary medallions to attain world domination and you have nine of them, everybody in your party still thinks it is necessary to bring the nine to the villain‚Äôs castle and get the final one, instead of hiding the ones they‚Äôve already got and spoiling his plans that way. After you foolishly bring the legendary medallions to the villain‚Äôs hideout, he will kidnap one of your companions (usually the main love interest) and you will trade the world away to rescue your friend.</li>
<li><strong>Dark Helmet‚Äôs Corollary</strong> - After you give up the medallions to save your friend/parent/lover/other miscellaneous party member, don‚Äôt expect to actually get that person back. Sucker!</li>
<li><strong>It‚Äôs Not My Department, Says Wernher Von Braun</strong> - All space stations, flying cities, floating continents and so forth will without exception either be blown up or crash violently to earth before the end of the game.</li>
<li><strong>The Best-Laid Schemes</strong> - The final villain‚Äôs grand scheme will have involved the deaths of thousands or even millions of innocent people, the clever manipulation of governments, armies, and entire populations, and will have taken anywhere from five to five thousand years to come to fruition. The hero will come up with a method of undoing this plan forever in less than five minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Pyrrhic Victory</strong> - By the time you‚Äôve gotten it in gear, dealt with your miscellaneous personal crises and are finally ready to go Save the World once and for all, nine-tenths of it will already have been destroyed. Still, you‚Äôve got to give your all to save the remaining one-tenth.</li>
<li><strong>Poetic Villain Principle (Kefka Rule)</strong> - All villains will suddenly become poets, philisophers, and/or dramatic actors when a) they first meet the hero, b) they are about to win or their evil plan is finally ready, c) some major event in the game is about to begin, d) right before the final battle, and e) right before they die, when they will frequently be feeling generous enough to reward you with some homespun wisdom about making the most of life while you have it.</li>
<li><strong>Compression of Time</strong> - As you approach the final confrontation with the villain, events will become increasingly awkward, contrived and disconnected from one another ‚Äì almost as if some cosmic Author was running up against a deadline and had to slap together the ending at the last minute.</li>
<li><strong>Adam Smith‚Äôs Revenge</strong> - By the end of the game you are renowned everywhere as the Legendary Heroes, every surviving government and authority figure has rallied behind you, the fate of the world is obviously hanging in the balance, and out of nowhere random passers-by give you a pat on the back and heartfelt good luck wishes. However, shopkeepers won‚Äôt even give you a discount, much less free supplies for the final battle with evil.</li>
<li><strong>Adam Smith‚Äôs Corollary</strong> - No matter how thoroughly devastated the continent/planet/universe is, there‚Äôs always some shopkeeper who survived the end of the world and sits outside the gates of the villain‚Äôs castle, selling the most powerful equipment in the game, like nothing ever happened.</li>
<li><strong>The Long Arm of the Plot</strong> - Any bad guys, no matter how far they run, will always end up in one of two ways by the end of the game: obviously dead, or on your side. There is no in-between.</li>
<li><strong>Apocalypse Any Time Now</strong> - The best time to do side quests is while the huge meteor hovers in the sky above the planet, waiting to fall and destroy the world.</li>
<li><strong>‚ÄúSo, Andross, you reveal your true form!‚Äù</strong> - You will have to kill the evil villain at least twice at the end of the game. First the villain will look like a person or some creature and be rather easy to kill. Then he will grow to about 50 times the hero‚Äôs size and be much harder to kill.</li>
<li><strong>In Your Face, Jesus!</strong> - Even if you manage to deal with him that time, you‚Äôre not done ‚Äì the villain will then transform into his final form, which is always an angelic winged figure with background music remixed for ecstatic chorus and pipe organ.</li>
<li><strong>The Moral Of The Story (Ghaleon Rule)</strong> - Every problem in the universe can be solved by finding the right long-haired prettyboy and beating the crap out of him.</li>
<li><strong>Weapon Rule</strong> - There‚Äôs always a hidden creature who is much harder to defeat than even the ultimate bad guy‚Äôs final, world-annihilating form. It‚Äôs lucky for all concerned that this hidden creature prefers to stay hidden rather than trying to take over the world himself, because he‚Äôd probably win. As a corollary, whatever reward you get for killing the hidden creature is basically worthless because by the time you‚Äôre powerful enough to defeat him, you don‚Äôt need it any more.</li>
<li><strong>The Ultimate Rule</strong> - Anything called ‚ÄúUltima (whatever)‚Äù or ‚ÄúUltimate (whatever)‚Äù isn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs always at least one thing somewhere in the world which is even more.</li>
<li><strong>Know Your Audience (Vyse Rule)</strong> - Every woman in the game will find the male lead incredibly attractive.</li>
