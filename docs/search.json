Even if I hated writing essays, I could make a persuasive argument and get the A I wanted.\nHowever, after attending grad school and now being in the workforce, writing a piece that was at least 8 pages and had many sources to back up its argument isn’t valuable.\nInstead, focused and technical writing prowess is valued. The storytelling aspect I developed with my academic writing still held value, but the method of utilizing that skill had to change. People are plowing through many different messages every day and don’t have the focus to read through an academic essay.\nSo I figured I’d write a short blog post detailing a few things I’ve learned. These are the tips I’ve used for getting my writing to be more concise and easier to read:"

    "text": "Python is seen by far across the industry as the most important programming language to know for doing data science. It has flexibility for being used for both general programming purposes and data science (as opposed to R, which was built for statistical computing first and foremost).\nHowever, because Python was built as a general programming language first, I always found it frustrating to navigate the various clunky integrated development environments (also known as IDEs) that existed and were compatible with the language. Compared to the robust data-science focused development of RStudio, Python’s options always left me with enough pain points with my workflow that I’d rather develop in R over Python when given the option.\nThat all changed when I found out how wonderful Visual Studio Code is. Before I get into the benefits of Visual Studio Code, I’ll discuss some of the other IDEs I tried using and the various frustrations I ran into using them:"

The labor of love shows with a vastly superior Python IDE.\nPros:\n\nEasy access to a function’s docstrings. The amount of time I had to waste opening webpages to look up official documentation for function syntax has been greatly reduced by being able to hover over a function and easily see what arguments it takes. It’s honestly even nicer than using RStudio, where you can still need to type ?function_name to get the documentation to pop up.\nHandles both Jupyter Notebooks and .py files. Say goodbye to swapping between two different IDEs just to work with one or the other.\nSwapping Virtual Environments is super easy. Rather than have to load a specific virtual environment from Anaconda when you open your IDE, you can simply choose on the fly to swap which environment you’re working in. Even R doesn’t make it that simple.\nEncourages best software development practices, including:\n\nCode linting\nDocstrings for functions (can be automatically done with an extension called Python Docstring Generator)\nGit integration\n\nIntellisense! Not having to write out everything by hand is a huge time saver.\nOh, and you can code in other languages too - it supports JavaScript, HTML5, and many others.\n\nCons:\n\nAs far as I can tell, getting visualizations in a pane in VS Code like RStudio/Spyder isn’t easy to do. But that can be adapted around by other means, so it’s a minor pain point."

Throughout the 2010s, I had phases where I was addicted to a combination of the following at any one time:\n**I’m not gonna lie - I’m still addicted to this one. There’s so much good free content on YouTube that compels me back to using the site again and again.\nThese are just the most popular sites, but my compulsion also affected lesser-known sites as well. I was never a “Spend my entire day on the sites” person, but it was a long enough period of time that could be spent in much better ways.\nI realized this was an increasingly horrifying problem at the start of grad school (around 2017), but over the years I’ve become increasingly horrified at the depths that social media goes to addict users to checking. There were quite a few stopping and starting points along the way - in periods of stress I was compelled back to spending a lot of time on the sites once again.\nIt was also hard for me to catch when things were going astray, too. Often I would hop around on different social media sites so it didn’t seem like I spent all my time on one spot. Each outlet served the same purpose of distracting myself from something, but offered little to no long-term value to my life.\nWith 2021 being a fresh start, I’m ready to make changes to clean the slate and start anew."

Even though a lot of the sites I deleted I don’t frequent much anymore, deleting them helped me distance myself from the person I was in my early 20s.\nMy social media usage now focuses strictly on the purpose of the activity. It currently looks like this:\n\nWork-required tools (Microsoft Teams and Outlook)\nArticle aggregation (Feedly and Pocket)\nBook aggregation (Goodreads)\nOnline messaging (Discord and Messenger)\nProfessional presence (LinkedIn, Github (if that even counts))\nEducational video content (YouTube, LinkedIn Learning)\n\nIt’s still not exactly where I want things to be, but overall, it’s a step in the right direction. I’ve kept a couple of old social media sites around (mainly my Twitter account) for now. But I rarely check it, and I’m saving that one more out of nostalgia than anything.\n\nConclusion\nI look forward to a decade with a further decreased presence on social media. I’ll still be around on this blog and some other select places, so I don’t plan on vanishing. But my time is too valuable to be everywhere at once now. If I want to accomplish my life goals I’ve set out for myself, I realize that I can’t waste my time on these sites anymore."

Matplotlib and Seaborn are certainly functional plotting libraries, but compared to R’s ggplot2 the visualizations were not up to snuff.\nThat’s where Plotly comes in. Plotly is a multi-platform library that supports JavaScript, R, and Python. In R, Plotly can seamlessly wrap around any ggplot object and make it an interactive plot, which makes it incredibly convenient to use. In Python, there is a low-code plotting option called plotly.express that can use for a similar effect, but there’s also the functionality for building more complex plots layer by layer.\nPlotly is also convenient because you can borrow themes from other common plotting libraries and have them applied to your plots by changing one parameter. For standardizing visualizations between R and Python, Plotly has been a lifesaver. (For a project our team tried using PlotNine for standardizing visuals, and it was clunky.)\nIn fact, I’ve found Plotly so nice in Python that I’m developing a library which saves the plot configurations for the ones used most frequently in my current role."

    "text": "Object Oriented Programming Isn’t That Scary\nCoding in an object-oriented programming manner in R is far from intuitive. There are multiple class structures to choose from, and more often than not you can get by with putting your reusable code in a function and be fine.\nAdmittedly coding in functions also works in Python, but since it’s known as an object oriented programming language, open-source “Pythonic” code will follow the OOP structure more frequently. The first time I was exposed to it in Python code I found it foreign. It seemed needlessly complicated and clunky for most data science workflows.\nHowever, implementing a class-based structure in certain situations can be beneficial. Something that’s now obvious to me after working in a larger organization is the importance of code sustainability and reusability. By programming in a standardized format like OOP, that organization makes it easier for others to follow and work with your code. It’s not necessarily fun (at least to me) to write code in such a manner, and sometimes it just makes a simple data science ask overly complicated. But for code that you expect to reuse, the benefits can make restructuring your code worthwhile."

(I know Spyder is somewhat like R Markdown, but it’s not as robust.)\nHowever, Sphinx helps fill the gap as a companion guide. Creating documentation is as easy as having properly formatted docstrings and running a few lines of code on the command line. It makes worth both more reproducible and easier to remember if/when you have to go back to it. (And personally I think readthedocs is a bit less finnicky than using pkgdown, R’s equivalent.

I could be around a group of people and feel profoundly lonely. This sometimes led to self-loathing and avoiding social interactions entirely.\nI didn’t try to do much about feeling lonely until I graduated high school, though.

    "text": "Personal Reasons For Buying Now\n\nBeing Closer to Home\nWhen I moved out here for this job, I was confident that I would be able to establish a strong social network like I did in grad school to help me get acclimated to a new area. However, my plan was derailed for a couple key reasons: * General increased difficulty making friends out of college * The pandemic\nI anticipated the former, and was lucky enough to befriend coworkers at my current workplace. That helped out when I was going to the office every day, but between adjusting to a new area and a new job I didn’t have a lot of time to invest in building a social network in the area. I was planning to develop that more strongly once I had my footing at my new job…\nAnd then COVID-19 said hello. That derailed any plans I had for meeting people in person, forcing social interactions to become remote in the name of public safety. I went months communicating with people only through electronic means, and the effect on my mental health was not pleasant. As an introvert, I was able to weather the effects of the consistent isolation better than most, but I was not immune to feeling lonely and depressed from the current reality.\nHowever, COVID-19 also offered a silver lining. Despite the tragic nature of everything that has happened, it accelerated the push towards remote work. Previously I was in the office every day, and in a world without COVID-19, that would still be the case. I would need to find another job closer to where I wanted to live to be closer to my established support network.\nBut in this new normal, I can keep my current job and work in a location more convenient for me (thankfully I work somewhere that’s willing to be flexible in that sense). That gives me confidence to live in a fixed location and not rely on the renting indefinitely.\n\n\nBad Landlords\nWhen I rented in grad school, I had a very good landlord. There was occasional noise from neighbors that bugged me, but because it was in a college town and mostly full of grad school residents, the quality was solid. Repairs were made in a timely fashion and even though my apartment was tiny and lacked a dishwasher, I managed.\nWhile my current apartment has more amenities (like a dishwasher, central air, and nearly double the square footage space), it also has incompetent management. I have had a hole in my ceiling for over 3 months now due to a leak in the apartment above me, and maintenance has still not fixed it. I was without consistent heat last winter for over a month due to poor fixes to my apartment’s heating system. Stomping is regularly heard by neighbors above me, and I clearly hear domestic disputes in a next-door apartment. Rent increases are at the whim of my landlord, and due to living in a growing area, have made a previously affordable cost of living increasingly more expensive.\nAt this point, I have realized my values of privacy and quiet are nearly impossible to get in most apartment complexes. You have no control over your neighbors when renting, but with a house you can control the noise (and screen the nearby houses to make sure you are okay with potential neighbors).\n\n\nStability\nA house offers you a stable place that you can live, whereas renting does not offer that flexibility. My current landlord has decided on renovations for my building, thus forcing everyone to move in a couple of months, regardless of their tenant status. After having to move 4 times in 4 years, I’m tired of hauling around all my crap long distances and paying both the financial and physical/emotional costs associated with moving.\nI’m ready to have a stable place to live. My mental health will benefit being in one location consistently, as the anxiety of being in a location only temporarily was not the type of stress I was built to handle well. The ability to put down roots and connect to a local community will offer me a lot of peace of mind."

    "text": "Financial Reasons For Buying Now\n\nLow Interest Rates\nInterest rates for mortgages are near an all-time low. Previously interest rates would vary between 6-15%, but right now rates are around 3%. This has led to an influx of external investors coming in to buy single-family homes in particular, the reasons of which could make its own disturbing article. Even if it’s hard for most people to take advantage of the low interest rates in this fire-hot housing market, I wanted to see what I could manage given the ability to buy a house in a lower cost of living and slightly less desirable area.\n\n\nRising Rents\nIn the area I currently live in, the rent for my apartment have risen over 10% in the two years I’ve lived there. Mortgages, even 30-year fixed mortgages, can experience increases through property taxes and insurance; however, the increases experienced through those reasons are already built into any landlord’s rent payments.\n\n\nHigh Inflation\nRight now we’re currently in a period of high inflation. When inflation is high, taking on fixed-interest debt is a solid strategy, as the value of the loan deteriorates due to the devaluing of the dollar.\n\n\nAbility to Put 20% Down in Cash\nThere are mortgages available where you do not need to have a 20% down payment of cash at the ready to get a house, particularly mortgages for first-time homebuyers. I considered these options, but decided to stick with a traditional mortgage structure for a couple of reasons:\n\nHaving substantial equity in the home in case of an economic downturn\nAvoiding paying PMI (Personal Mortgage Insurance)\n\nIn the case of the former, I do not expect a market downturn given recent behavior in the housing market. This is mainly due to inflation, lack of new housing, and investment firms buying many single family homes to make into AirBnbs/permanent rentals. However, if one were to occur and the value of my home decreased, by putting 20% down I hedge against being “underwater”, where the amount of debt I owe on the home is worth more than the house’s value.\nIn the case of the latter, PMI is an additional expense that a lender would expect you to pay if you put down less than 20% for a mortgage. The less you put down for a home, the most it costs. For the price range of homes I was looking for, it’s not a huge expense on its own, but on top of paying more in interest and that added monthly payment, over time it adds up. Admittedly there’s an opportunity cost to putting money towards a home and say, not in the stock market; however, I have invested other money towards retirement and felt the peace of mind with having a house beat the uncertainty associated with renting."

    "text": "The Opportunity Cost of Buying a Home\nMany people will say real estate is an investment and that renting is equivalent to “throwing your money away”. I don’t think it’s as black and white as that. My situation to finally buy a house was a combination of many factors:\n\nA high-paying stable job that I enjoy\nThe ability to work remotely indefinitely\nNo student loans\nHigh credit scores\nHaving 20% down for a mortgage payment AND 6% to cover closing costs associated with buying a house in savings/checking\nMoney invested in retirement through 401(k) and a Roth IRA\nPersonal and financial reasons listed above\n\nIf it weren’t for all those factors, buying a home would be a much harder psychological sell. The money for my down payment and closing costs could easily be put in the stock market, which if invested properly could average a return greater than the appreciation of the value of a house. I’d have the flexibility to move in case I wanted to live elsewhere. I wouldn’t need to mow a lawn or shovel my own driveway.\nBut for all the reasons listed above, the time to get out of the rent race was now. I stayed within my budget for buying a home, not going above 2.5 times my annual income for the final cost. (General rule of thumb I found online.) The house I live in will be much larger and nicer than an apartment, and I know it’s mine. For that alone, it was worth it."

For the longest time, I found making this choice very overwhelming, and I struggled with figuring out which would be most appropriate for me.\nThere are many choices out there for game development in 2020. There are the engines geared towards people who aren’t coders, such as RPG Maker and Game Maker Studio. There are the very popular engines such as Unity or Unreal. And then there are the more niche, open source engines like Godot or Ren’Py. I considered all of these engines as potential choices for game creation, but the main two I’ve given more than a cursory glance towards were Godot and RPG Maker."

    "section": "What’s New in DataCamp",
    "text": "What’s New in DataCamp\nSince I last was on DataCamp there have been a lot of changes. At a high level I’ve noticed these things:\n\nA Larger Emphasis on Data Engineering\nThis reflects the current job market, as there’s a much higher need for people who can ETL data as opposed to build a model off of it. I noticed DataCamp had many more courses in areas such as: * SQL Server * Spark * Bash & Shell Scripting * AWS (though the selection here is still fairly slim)\nI recently went through the Data Engineer with Python path to get a better understanding of the modern tools used. The Python courses in the track were a good refresher ways to code efficiently, but there was also exposure to robust automation methods like Airflow I hadn’t used before.\nMy workplace recently shifted towards using Linux for its data science Virtual Machines, so the courses on Bash and Shell scripting in the track were very timely. They helped me navigate the command line to set up various programs on the server and automate current data science workflows on there via cron jobs.\nSome of the courses weren’t directly applicable to my current role, but the majority either taught me a useful skill to help build more reliable pipelines for my data science work or gave me a better understanding of the tasks the data engineers at my company perform on a regular basis.\n\n\nA Larger Emphasis on Business Intelligence Tools\nAnother reflection of the job market is an investment in courses focused on dashboarding technologies, including: * Power BI * Tableau * Shiny * Dash (though there’s only one course on this)\nIn my past experiences using Tableau I’ve found its capabilities in a data scientist capacity somewhat limiting. As a collaboration tool its way of saving workbooks makes it so you can’t compare differences between versions on Git easily. Because of that I’m a bit surprised DataCamp has so many courses now on the tool. However, drag-and-drop tools that purport to make things simpler have a much lower barrier to entry than traditional software development practices, so I can understand why DataCamp is capitalizing on the demand.\nI rely on R Shiny for dashboarding in R and have not found a preferred tool for dashboarding in Python. In the past, I have used Streamlit, but have found it to be laggy for end users to experiment with. I will experiment with Dash in the future to see if it’s a more effective tool for Python dashboarding needs.\n\n\nAssessment of Skill Levels\nSince I last used DataCamp they have added a tool in order to evaluate your skills called DataCamp Signal. After taking a timed quiz that adapts to your current skill level based on whether you get the question right or wrong, you get a number between 0 and 200 that tells you whether your expertise is either Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced.\nIt’s a neat tool. I like messing around with it to see what functions are “expected” to be known, and it can be a good reminder when I can’t think of the proper function to solve within 60 seconds (yeah, you don’t get time to Google the solution). However, some of the questions can be repetitive and awfully specific (one quiz asked me to make a ggplot scatterplot 3 times) so I wouldn’t call it a perfect replacement for vetting a candidate’s skills.\n\n\nCertifications vs Statements of Accomplishment\nWhen I previously used DataCamp they only had statements of accomplishment for their Data Analyst and Data Scientist in R paths. However, they now offer a Data Science Professional certification specializing in either R or Python. In order to obtain the certification there are three assessments, a case study (with presentation component to technical and non-technical audiences), and a coding challenge.\nGiven where I currently am my career I don’t have a need for a certification. However, if you’re already paying to access their premium content, it doesn’t seem to cost you any extra money to get certified. Further, DataCamp says they have a career services team that will work to get you a job in data science once you’re certified.\nI’m generally dubious about the value of all of these different certifications that are appearing for data science. Having been on the other side of the hiring table it’s hard to validate the effectiveness of any one particular certification, so it ends up being reliant on how well you interview. However, relevant certifications show you’re a “go-getter” and DataCamp has decent quality associated with them, so you could certainly do worse if you were seeking out a certification for a career change."

    "text": "1. The Data Is (Usually) Ugly\nIn grad school, a lot of the datasets that my cohort worked with were relatively clean. They were canned datasets so there were no ambiguities about data definitions, and there were few, if any, missing values. (Well, outside the lecture where we were taught about missing values, that is.)\nReal-life data isn’t like that. Often a lot of work goes into just cleaning up the data so that it can be reasonably used for analysis.\nFor example, being in a large healthcare system, data defintions aren’t always clear nor consistent. When looking across different parts of the organization, a lot of work often goes into making sure defintions for data being stored “match”. Much more emphasis goes into merging and maintaining those datasets than is ever discussed while in school.\nData is also generally not structured in the best format for analysis. You often have to structure the data so that it’s appropriate for ingestion into an algorithm. This can be done via SQL or through programming language packages like the Tidyverse (for R) or Pandas (for Python).\nIn general, sometimes you’re just a data janitor, not a data scientist. Perfect data never exists."

I dreamed of reporting on the biggest stories going on in the world and providing that information to regular citizens in an easily digestible format.\nAfter witnessing the 2008 recession and massive cuts to local newspapers, I decided against going down that path. But I ended up finding a career path where telling stories was still hugely important.\nHumans are storytellers. Stories tend to stick in a person’s brain more effectively and can persuade leadership to make appropriate business decisions with your statistical analyses.\nYou can certainly tell a person with pure statistical outputs what is going on; this was what was required of presentations that were given when I was in graduate school. However, unless you’re surrounded by people with similar technical ability, the meaning will be drawn out and muddled. Leadership has maybe 15 minutes to consider what you’re talking about, and odds are most of them think a pie chart is the best way to visualize data.\nData scientists are expected to communicate the boundary between analysis and actionable steps. You need to tailor your presentations to leadership to ensure that a cohesive and compelling narrative is being told. A story will motivate leadership to act; an analysis will just be “another meeting” to them."

    "text": "3. Everybody Loves Python\nBack in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic changed all our lives forever. Many tragically passed due to the disease, employment situations rapidly changed (whether it be working from home or layoffs due to a recession), and social distancing is now part of the social lexicon.\nDuring this time, the data scientists on our team were expected to forecast how COVID-19 would impact our various hospital systems. Having no background in epidemiology, we did a lot of research into understanding how diseases generally progressed as well as noting what pre-existing models were doing for modelling the impact on hospital beds.\nNearly all these models were built in Python.\nUp to that point, I was almost exclusively an R user. This job didn’t care whether you used R or Python, and a lot of previous analyses by former data scientists were done in R, so there wasn’t much motivation to switch languages. The culture was set for using R, and early into my role I wasn’t about to change that.\nI wasn’t completely clueless about Python, because when I was job hunting I knew places generally preferred Python to R. I understood the basic syntax of Python and could do an ad-hoc analysis hitting up pandas and scikit-learn if I needed to. However, I didn’t have an understanding of object-oriented programming and other Pythonic coding principles, so when these epidemiology algorithms were posted by computer scientists, it was very easy to get lost.\nAfter a few months, we eventually went away from using open-source algorithms and developed in-house models built in R for forecasting hospital bed utilization. But that experience was a wake-up call for me.\nYou don’t just need to know how to code in Python with the basic data science packages (matplotlib, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc) and crank out an analysis. You need to be able to code in Python like a software developer does.\nOver the past few months, one of my professional development goals has been to fill those gaps and learn object-oriented design in Python. It’s not been easy given that I don’t have a computer science background, and it’s very easy for me to still get tripped up by the various jargon. But I can already tell that my coding skills have improved by investing my time towards this."

    "text": "4. You Can’t Know Everything\nI know I just made a point above about knowing Python. Learning the language deeply is really the best bang for your buck you can make for your technical skillset as a data scientist.\nBut some job applications will list any tool under the sun that they expect a prospective data scientist to know. These can include the following:\n\nR\nPython\nSQL\nJulia\nSAS\nMATLAB\nJava\nTableau\nPower BI\nHadoop\nSpark\nHive\nExcel\nDocker\nGit\netc…\n\nAnd that doesn’t even includ the specifics that might be expected of someone who knows that particular language. For example, if you know base Python they’ll also expect you to know:\n\nTensorflow\nKeras\nPyTorch\nScikit-Learn\nNLTK\nPandas\nNumPy\nSciPy\nMatplotlib\nSeaborn\nPlotly\netc…\n\nAnd to be able to use those packages in Python appropriately you’ll need the data science technical skills to understand these very broad topics:\n\nData Preprocessing/Cleaning\nData Visualization\nPredictive Modelling\nSupervised vs Unsupervised Learning\nNatural Language Processing\nDeep Learning and Neural Networks\n\nNone of those broader data science skills are easily picked up overnight. Further, to be a master in all of those languages above, it would take a long time. It’s not feasible to know them all, and further, you don’t need to know them all.\nObviously, knowing the theoretical concepts is critical. You’ll need those with whatever language you choose, so don’t skimp on that piece of things. As far as languages go, here’s what I’ve settled on regarding data science programming in 2021:\n\nR for statistical analyses\n\nI have 4 years of experience here and R is built for this. It feels wasteful not to use R for what it’s meant for.\n\nPython for deep learning and natural language processing\n\nPython is ahead of the game compared to R in this regard. I know you can build a neural network in R without any trouble, but Python gets the latest and greatest algorithms built for it first. Plus, see point 3.\n\nSQL for obtaining data\n\nNo matter what language you use, you’ll need to pull data. Both R and Python can connect to ODBC sources for this.\n\nGit for version control\n\nAgain, no matter what language you use, being able to document and reproduce your code as the build goes along will be invaluable.\n\nExcel for the stupid simple stuff\n\nIt’s true - even as a data scientist some things will be easier to just do in Excel.\n\n\nThe rest of the languages and their usage depends on the company. For some of you reading, you may see no need to learn R, but for my current job knowing R is essential.\nAnyway, if you’re searching for a data science job and get overwhelmed by all the “wants” in a job description, I recommend focusing on those I highlighted (prioritizing Python and SQL first) and the data science technical skills needed to use those languages effectively."

All it takes is one hacker getting in on one site, and now they know your information for every site. Password managers are a great way to autogenerate passwords and have them available on both desktop and mobile devices. I’ve had good luck using LastPass (2024 Update - please don’t use LastPass! I now recommend Bitwarden), but I know there are alternatives available (KeePass, 1Password) if you aren’t comfortable with that particular tool.\n\n\nHTTPS Everywhere\nThis extension makes sure your connections are https whenever possible (as opposed to http). This makes any communication you do on websites far more secure.\n\n\nDecentraleyes\nThis extension (to put it simply) comes bundled with some commonly used files that websites generally rely on hitting third-party servers for to load. (Web developers rely on the third-party options because they are cheaper.) Thus, this extension helps to save on both bandwidth and privacy concerns, and this extension is built to complement a lot of other common privacy tools.\n\n\nAd Blockers\nThese are the ones most people have probably heard of before. uBlock Origin is currently the best one out there. Ghostery is also one, but does a bit of everything; it blocks ads, stops trackers, and speeds up websites (according to its tagline). If you want to support a website/creator I recommending turning the blocker off for them so that they can get the advertising revenue, but if you’re venturing into a site where you’re not sure about the content’s reliability, having an ad blocker on can save you a lot of headaches."

Often, this extension adds enough friction that saves me from doomscrolling about the state of the world. Currently, the extension supports blocking feeds on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit. It’s personally not as useful to me now that I’ve stepped back heavily from social media, but keeping that barrier help has added additional insurance that I won’t slip back into old habits.\n\n\nDistraction-Free YouTube\nYouTube is still my biggest weakness when it comes to bad internet habits. This extension is a livesaver, though, as it clears out the clutter that causes you to waste time on YouTube. You can block comments, hide sidebar recommendations, and disable autoplay. It makes the viewing experience much calmer.\n\n\nLeechBlock\nThis extension will limit access to websites that you don’t want to visit in moments of weak willpower. You can give yourself a set time period every day to look at a site if you just want to reduce usage, or if the site isn’t adding any value to your life, you can block access to it entirely. The extension also adds friction to be able to change which sites are accessible or not, and you can determine how severe that friction is.

It’s a powerful interface for developing apps, but I would not describe it as intuitive to a newcomer. There was a pretty hefty learning curve where I had to learn navigating the GUI and understanding both the formatting and location of files in an application.\nI came across many different terms I had not heard before. Before building this app, I couldn’t tell you what the difference between a fragment and an activity was. I didn’t know anything about user interface (UI) design prior to this, and through trial and error I learned what kept the app both functional and fast.

You may recognize some of these in your own experiences, and perhaps they are a rite of passage that all developers have to learn eventually.\n\nScope Creep\nI almost let my initial idea for an app become so complex that it stopped me from completing it. My app ended up with far more content than I ever intended it to initially. When I first started building it I wanted to focus on having just a few things available for people, and to build on if I was interested later with new features.\nThat didn’t happen, though. I decided that I should cover more therapies and make the app more robust, which added to development time. An app that could have reasonably been completed months earlier wasn’t because I decided I needed to tinker with it until it met my standards.\nIn hindsight, if I had planned this app out more carefully rather than put it together as I went, I could have avoided this scope creep. Now that I have experience working in a large-scale organization, I have also seen scope creep affect other projects and believe that I am better equipped to resist the pull of a “bigger and better” result.\n\n\nNot Using Version Control\nYeah, I know. I can feel the glares coming through the screen. If you look in the GitHub repository of my code for this project, you’ll see that there are old versions of files that are in there. However, I did not go out of my way to put them there. That only happened because Windows periodically backed up my save files, not because I went out of my way to do so.\n(In newer versions of Android Studio version control is automatically built into the application. So perhaps I would have practiced better version control habits for reproducibility purpose had this feature been built in a year ago.)\nAnyway, the reason this was a learning lesson because I lost time and progress because I didn’t practice good version control habits. At one point, my strings.xml file had its format altered, and my app because unusable as a result. It took hours to fix a change that, with proper version control, I could have just reverted to a previous version in a minute. Sometimes you just have to learn those lessons the hard way to realize their importance, I suppose.\n\n\nNot Commenting Well Enough\nThis one plagued me when I took breaks between working on this project. I was lazy with commenting what new features I added to this application and just assumed I would remember what I was doing months ago. Unsurprisingly, I regularly forgot what changes I made and had to spend time re-learning something all over again, when commenting would have saved trouble in the long run.\nIt’s embarrassing looking back how little I kept track of what every step of my code did, and one of the major lessons learned I took away from this project was to comment any future work thoroughly in such a way that I would not be confused when I looked back at it later on. (Thankfully when using R it’s easy to use R Markdown files, and when using Python Jupyter Notebooks allows for Markdown and code chunks. So it’s become standard practice when I have to code on the job for me now, to the point of seeming excessive to my colleagues.)"

    "text": "The Good of 2023\n\nMore Travel Goals Met\nI was able to travel quite a bit this year, including going to the following areas:\n\nWisconsin\nNational Parks near Las Vegas and Maine\nNew Orleans\n\nTo start off, here are the national parks I managed to visit. There was a few in July, including the Grand Canyon:\n\n\n\nGrand Canyon - Bright Angel Point\n\n\nBryce Canyon National Park:\n\n\n\nBryce Canyon - Queens/Navajo Combination Loop\n\n\nand Zion National Park:\n\n\n\nZion National Park - The Narrows\n\n\nAdditionally, I was able to hit Acadia in September:\n\n\n\nAcadia - Beehive Loop\n\n\nBesides national parks, I was also was able to go to New Orleans in December:\n\n\n\nNew Orleans - French Quarter\n\n\nOverall, I’ve knocked off even more places that were on my travel bucket list in 2023, and I’m looking forward to visiting some more places in 2024.\n\n\nFinding Peace in Doing Things Alone\nIn June, I was lucky enough to be able to take a solo trip for a work conference. This was the first time I had ever traveled across states without knowing a single person at the location I went to (I’ve traveled alone in airplanes, but usually friends/family awaited me at the airport).\nGetting a rental car and exploring an unfamiliar area solo was nerve-wracking, especially as there were a few anxiety-inducing situations that happened on the trip (getting attacked by birds, a deer almost running into me, and learning I get claustrophobic in caves). However, I’m glad I took advantage of the opportunity my workplace gave me and did the trip.\n\n\n\nMadison - Olbrich Botanical Gardens\n\n\nI tried to take that approach into other areas of my life, including solo hiking and attending local events by myself throughout the year. These were easier to do solo than a trip to another state, and I’m slowly getting better at putting myself out there at events where I don’t know another soul in attendance. I still don’t like it, but I am building confidence in the fact that I can indeed do it.\n\n\nA More Optimal Financial Setup\nThis isn’t a particularly “fun” topic, but I took another look at my financial setup and finally opened up a high-yield savings account to take advantage of high interest rates. This isn’t exactly a life-altering change, but it has resulted in me making more in interest on my liquid savings, and every little bit helps as I consider my future financial goals."

    "text": "The Bad of 2023\n\nLoneliness is Relentless\nUnfortunately I had a family member pass early in January from cancer, which really didn’t set a good tone for how 2023 was going to go. This led to some infighting amongst my extended family, which is never any fun to deal with.\nUltimately, the above was a wake-up call to a bitter truth that I needed to swallow. I grieved and accepted I won’t have the family relationships that I wish I did. I’m not like the rest of my family; for example, most of them were lucky to graduate high school, yet I obtained a Master’s degree. I recognize overall it’s not a bad thing to be different in this situation, but I won’t lie, it’s easy to feel envious of others who do have those relationships in their life.\nI also didn’t make any progress in building more meaningful relationships (romantic, platonic, or otherwise) in 2023. (This feels embarrassing to type out, as this has been a goal of mine for years now.) I know it wasn’t for a lack of effort, as I focused on local in-person events and Meetup groups for 2023. Unfortunately, they simply didn’t pan out as I hoped.\nI’m trying to approach this disappointment with radical acceptance, telling myself that “it is what it is” and that my self-worth is not defined by the quality and/or quantity of relationships I have currently in my life. I’m also trying to cut myself some slack; most people would struggle with loneliness if they had to spend effectively two years completely isolated due to COVID, WFH, and living in a new location.\n\n\nHealth Stressors\nIn the early months of 2023, I dealt with muscle twitching across my entire body. For a while I thought this was due to handling stress poorly, but I eventually was able to remedy the issue by upping my calcium intake (pro-tip for anyone who runs into this issue!), but when it happened near constantly for months on end prior, I was incredibly stressed out."

However, a silver lining of remote work is that data analytics jobs don’t necessarily need to be done in a specific location, so I was able to leverage that to buy a place that’s much closer to where my family is located.\nAlthough buying a house has more stressors associated with it than renting does, I will say I appreciate the increased space, peace and quiet, and lower cost of living I’ve been afforded being able to move out of a larger city.\n\n\nMaking My First Game\nAs I referenced in a previous post, I made my first game, Edge of Chaos! Now that I have the confidence and learnings of that experience, I look forward to making the game I’ve always dreamed of over the next few years.\n\n\nThe Vaccine Making Travel Safer\nI had opportunities to travel in 2021, especially with being able to get vaccinated all the way back in January.\nI was able to visit my family in Florida:\n\nVisit Frederick Meijer Garden (highly recommended):\n\n\n\nFrederick Meijer Garden - Cherry Blossoms\n\n\nSaw a sunset on Lake Michigan (at the insistence of my coworkers) on the longest day of the year, which given that Michigan is on the edge of Eastern Standard Time, happened at 10 PM:\n\n\n\nLake Michigan\n\n\nSee stunning landscapes in Sleeping Bear Dunes:\n\n\n\nSleeping Bear Dunes\n\n\nAnd go to Philadelphia for the first time whilst attending PAX Unplugged:\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia, City of Stop Beating Up The Giants So Badly Please\n\n\nOverall, my 2021 was WAY more active than 2020."

    "text": "The Bad of 2021\n\nMore COVID Troubles\nNew variants, continued strain on the healthcare system, the politicizing of basic protections against the disease, and burnout are but a few of the problems that we all faced in the continued marathon against COVID-19. Many hospital systems are overrun with the Omicron variant and due to global mismanagement of vaccines, new variants will inevitably crop up going into 2022.\nThe economic fallout of the pandemic also can’t be underestimated. Inflation is at 6.8% in November 2021, the highest it’s been in 40 years. (Due to inflation we are also seeing shrinkflation and skimpflation, so that number is probably underestimating its true impact.) To combat inflation, interest rates will have to rise, which may cause yet another stock market tumble/recession.\n\n\nMental Health Struggles\nLoneliness cropped up pretty hard on me for parts of 2021, making it hard to function at the level that I would like to. Being able to move near the end of the year made things easier, but for the majority of the year prior to the move, outside of the travel referenced above, I barely met up with anyone. The prolonged isolation has impacted my personality and way of coping with stress, though with being closer to home I won’t be nearly as isolated for 2022.\nWith the loneliness my desire to follow healthy habits has also taken a hit. One of my main goals for 2022 is to get in good physical shape again, since 2 years of WFH and emotional eating haven’t done my body any favors. (It’s not as bad as it could be, but I could really be doing better in this regard and need to make some changes sooner rather than later.)\n\n\nTransitions\nThere’s obviously the hassle of moving states that is a part of this transition. But there’s more change going on in my career as well. The relative stability of my job last year has been in flux, with 3 different managers in 1 year, changing departments, and having the way work is completed be done through a new process in SAFe. Many favorite coworkers of mine have left for greener pastures, which is always hard to watch.\nHowever, the anxiety from transitions should alleviate since I won’t have to worry about where I’m living for a while, what with buying a house and all. So this downside likely won’t appear to this extent in any future years of my life (or at least I hope not)."

    "text": "The Good of 2020\n\nSustained Employment\nI’m one of the lucky ones, I know. I’ve had a job continuously in 2020 and have been able to contribute a lot towards the pandemic with regards to modelling and such. The stability of having a job helped me keep my focus on tasks at hand rather than ruminate at the state of the world, and for that I’m very grateful.\n\n\nLearning Many Things\nBoth personally and professionally, I learned a lot to further develop my skillset.\nProfessionally speaking, I became proficient in Python, version control, and further advanced my skills in R by developing a package. I presented at the HDAA Conference about an unsupervised learning algorithm and to executive leadership regarding surge modelling. Additionally, my workplace offered up LinkedIn Learning for all employees, so that has aided me in rounding out my skillset.\nPersonally speaking, I learned about the various facets of game development (of which there are many). I’ve begun an initial project in RPG Maker based on a D&D campaign I’m a part of, and hope to finish it in 2021. I’ve also started a blog and read over 50 books.\nAll things considered, I’ve been pretty productive.\n\n\nWorking from Home is Nice\nWorking from home isn’t perfect. You need to have strong boundaries to not end up at your computer all day. But the convenience of working from home is nice. Commuting stinks, and it’s nice to work and not have to wear real pants.\nAdmittedly I found working from home horrid for my back until I obtained a proper work setup, so that’s a necessary investment. And it’s harder to forget connections when you aren’t in an office with people on a regular basis, but it’s doable with the appropriate effort put in."

    "text": "The Bad of 2020\n\nCoronavirus\nI don’t really need to explain this one, do I? This virus has killed 300,000+ Americans and caused immeasurable suffering to people’s livelihoods from which they may never recover. Although a vaccine is finally being distributed, it’ll likely be until 2022 that life returns to some semblance of normal.\n\n\nMental Health Effects of Quarantining\nThis is an addendum to Coronavirus, but I think it deserves its own side note. Everyone’s mental health is at great risk during this pandemic and it will require a lot of healing to recover from this trauma.\nI can attest to the challenges of quarantining. I’ve been working from home since March, after moving to a new area in August to live alone in an apartment. I hadn’t met many people yet, mostly getting my social interaction in at work, and have stayed effectively holed up in my apartment for the last 9 months. In that time frame, I had a friend commit suicide, a family member die from stage IV cancer, and watched 30% of my coworkers get laid off. That’s all a lot to happen in a normal year, let alone a pandemic year. Not having normal relaxation methods available made it really hard to deal with, even as an introvert.\nI know various virtual avenues are available for socializing, but having a Zoom call with someone just isn’t the same as interacting with them in person. In general, when “normal” returns a lot of us are going to come out of this more socially awkward than we started. I already feel more social anxiety than I have in years on the rare occasions I do interact with people in person now, and it remains to be seen how long that will take to recede to previous levels.\n\n\nI Miss The Gym\nStaying at home makes it even easier to slide into a sedentary lifestyle. I try to mitigate that by working out on a regular basis, but it’s also closely related to maintaining my mental health. Over the years I’ve learned I work out best going when going to a fitness facility. However maintaining my physical health has been tricky with having to stay indoors, especially now that we’re approaching winter. It’s much harder to motivate myself when I’m always in my apartment and there’s no dedicated workout area. I have managed to stay at least vaguely in shape with Ring Fit Adventure (a Nintendo Switch video game) but I’m definitely not where I want to be fitness-wise.\n\n\nPolitical Tensions\nThe leadup to the 2020 election in America was a nightmare I think we’d all prefer to forget. The fallout, where Trump is still insisting he won despite all objective sources of truth saying otherwise, is undermining democracy as we know it. Millions of people have been laid off and are broke to the point of shoplifting baby food for their children due to inadequate COVID funding. Our government still hasn’t taken any meaningful action to stop mass shootings or address systemic racism. Following politics is just downright depressing.\nSure, the stock market looks great, but there’s a storm brewing with how desperate people are getting. I suspect we’ll see more fallout in 2021 from this, especially if the government doesn’t give people the assistance needed to survive."

I’ve gotten some experience with managing people and projects in this last year as well, which should serve me well with respect to my future career goals.\n\n\nCreating a “Second Brain”\nThis year, I came across the concept of a Second Brain after reading a book on the topic by Tiago Forte. A Second Brain (in non-self-help) terms is basically an organized digital space where any ideas, thoughts, or other information you might want to look back on in the future are stored.\nI’ve used OneNote since I started my current role, becoming a huge fan of its search feature in particular to find old notes. But while I enjoyed OneNote, I still wasn’t using it to its fullest potential since I wasn’t keeping it well-organized. I’d throw notes in wherever and hope that the search function would help me find whatever I had written down.\nNow, I’m much more deliberate with the process. It took many hours to organize my OneNote but now it’s much easier to find where things are located. Further, since notes are now in more logical areas, I can connect concepts together that previously I might have entirely missed out on.\nI know it sounds weird that one of my big wins this year basically amounted to being more disciplined and organizing better, but something clicked with me this year to take digital organization seriously. I firmly believe this change will pay huge dividends long-term for my personal development.\n\n\nTravel\nThis year I had the opportunity to travel to some different locations I hadn’t been previously.\nThe highlight of the year’s trips was one that I took to Colorado in the summer, which included visiting a zany museum in Denver called Meow Wolf:\n\n\n\nMeow Wolf - Convergence Station\n\n\nVisiting Black Canyon National Park:\n\n\n\nBlack Canyon of the Gunnison National Park\n\n\nAnd Rocky Mountain National Park:\n\n\n\nRocky Mountain National Park\n\n\nIt was my first time being in a different time zone, a mile above sea level, visiting a US national park, and in a desert. Colorado knocked off a lot of “firsts” for me!\nI also saw a light show called LUMA:\n\n\n\nBinghamton LUMA\n\n\nAnd I visited Pittsburgh for the first time, seeing the skyline at night from the Duquesne Incline:\n\n\n\nPittsburgh - Duquesne Incline\n\n\nI’m grateful that I’ve been able to go so many places this year."

    "text": "The Bad of 2022\n\n(All The) Stressors\n2022 wasn’t as tranquil as I was hoping for after buying my house.\nMy personal life has experienced a fair bit of turbulence this year that I wasn’t anticipating. Family members have had their health deteriorate due to cancer on both sides, which has increased long-running tensions. Further, I had to reset my social life after moving, and that’s taken up a lot of my time and energy.\nProfessionally, my workplace (Spectrum) merged with another health system (Beaumont) and rebranded themselves as Corewell Health. There’s not been any direct changes yet to my role, but mergers inherently come with additional stress. Though there’s been no direct changes to my role since the promotion, I will have a new boss in early 2023 as Corewell hires a director to grow its data science capabilities. While there’s a great opportunity with that transition, there’s always uncertainty whenever your manager changes.\nThen there’s been the general stressors that are societal, such as the economy, climate change, politics, etc. I won’t go into detail on those here, but living in interesting times isn’t what I’d call relaxing by any means.\n\n\nMissed Goals\nI was optimistic that the end of 2021 would lead to great changes that would ultimately help me reach my goals. Unfortunately, not all of these were necessarily reached in the way I was hoping for.\nI didn’t reach my fitness goals I had set at the end of 2021. While I didn’t necessarily make things worse in the last year, I didn’t progress in the way I was hoping for.\nI also didn’t reach my game development goals I was hoping I’d make in 2022 either. My next game has run into various creative blocks I didn’t experience in my first game, and I wasn’t able to flesh out the story for my game in a way I was satisfied with.\nLastly, despite prioritizing my social life and its stability in 2022, I didn’t meet my goals there. While my social situation has definitely improved compared to a year ago, I struggled with meeting people locally and relied on rekindling past friendships and acquaintanceships to rebuild my social life. That was a viable strategy that helped my situation, don’t get me wrong, but I didn’t meet many new people as a result. I’m hopeful that I can expand my social horizons in 2023 and be more of the friend I wish that I had growing up to others."

    "section": "Academic Education: Getting a Master’s Degree (or PhD)",
    "text": "Academic Education: Getting a Master’s Degree (or PhD)\nThe vast majority of data scientists have a Master’s degree in a relevant field. (I can be counted amongst this group, as I have a Master’s in Statistics.) Many job postings require a Master’s degree for education, so having that listed on your resume will be necessary to get through some companies’ applicant tracking systems (also known as their ATS).\nHowever, I want to emphasize that it’s not required to succeed. My coworker with the same job title as myself only has a Bachelor’s degree, and is as competent in the role as I am. He’s a motivated self-starter who was able to pick up on the more challenging nuances due to being talented and smart in his own right.\nI’ll be honest - a lot of what I learned in my Master’s program wasn’t directly applicable to what I do day-to-day in my current job. Some classes in my Master’s program were invaluable, especially the machine learning and regression classes, but the theoretical and proof-heavy courses have barely been touched upon since graduating.\n\nThe Opportunity Cost of Attending\nThere was also an opportunity cost to going to graduate school that I don’t think is called out enough in these types of articles.\nThere’s the financial cost, which included tuition and books. For the financial piece, I specifically chose a state school, Binghamton, rather than a school with a higher reputation, like Cornell or RIT, specifically as a cost reduction measure. A semester at Binghamton for an in-state student was around $6000, whereas Cornell or RIT would cost double or more. I also found a scholarship that was eligible for a state school but not for private, which influenced my decision too.\nHowever, beyond the financial cost, I also had to sacrifice holding a full-time job with benefits for those two years I attended, as the course load given by the professors required a full-time commitment from you alone (and then some). After getting my Bachelor’s degree, I could have tried to get my foot in the door in a less prestigious job title (such as a Data Analyst) somewhere and learned on the job while getting decent money and experience along the way.\nThat was not the right call for me in my situation. However, if you’re an experienced professional it’s worth considering the income loss taken if you stop working to attend graduate school full-time. It may make more sense to attend part-time after work hours, but stretch it out over 4 years. I know some friends and coworkers who have taken that approach to getting Master’s degrees, but that also has its own costs (mainly a loss of free time for the duration you’re getting your Master’s).\nDo I regret going to graduate school? No. It was a great opportunity to forge connections, and I was able to get a great position in my field not long after graduating. Because I was able to minimize the cost of attending (a luxury I know not everyone has), I did not feel the financial consequences of attending as acutely as others would."

    "section": "Professional Certifications",
    "text": "Professional Certifications\nThe alternatives that have appeared in lieu of traditional education are in the form of certifications. These options vary widely in quality, so it’s highly recommended to do your research on which end up being most useful for you in your given situation. Overall, I think the knowledge you’ll get from a certification will generally be more practical and specific to your day-to-day work and less focused on the theoretical underpinnings that you would get from a traditional/academic education.\nHowever, I’ve found that explaining data science certifications on a resume to be more challenging than listing traditional education, and since the quality varies so much getting certifications that aren’t specific/essential to a role (like Epic with their data certifications) they may not be seen as highly valuable beyond having a “self-learner” personality. Therefore, I generally list my certification progress on my LinkedIn page (and not a resume).\nBelow I’ll give an overview of some companies I’ve used resources for to upskill in data science:\n\nDataCamp\nThis was the first site I used to learn more about data science and R, mostly while I was in grad school (so 2018-2019). Their courses shift between traditional lectures and “fill in the blank” code challenges to test your understanding of the concepts. For reference, I took the course tracks “Data Analyst in R” and “Data Scientist in R” (which at the time had 80%+ course overlap).\nIt was through DataCamp that I learned how to use the Tidyverse in R, since most of my math professors in grad school were unfamiliar with the framework. The course quality was very high and I felt like I learned something in all of the courses I took. The main reason I withdrew my subscription was due to a controversy with its CEO, but I had also exhausted most of the material I had wanted to learn about at the time.\nI’d highly recommend DataCamp for upskilling in R and learning the basics of SQL. They have improved their catalog of courses for Python since I’ve last used the service, so it may also be valuable for learning and upskilling in Python as well. The cost of learning is very affordable relative to most (a couple hundred bucks a year).\n\n\nLinkedIn Learning\nMy workplace offered free access to LinkedIn Learning for all employees in September 2020, and I was eager to take advantage of it. I spent (probably way too much) time going through various Learning Paths, which were a collection between 5-12 courses related to developing or enhancing a specific skill. I primarily took Learning Paths to develop my proficiency in Python, NLP, deep learning, and general computer science principles, but I also took a couple of paths to refine my skills in R, SQL, and business communication. (What can I say? I like the low, low cost of free.)\nLinkedIn Learning offers video lectures and you complete a course once you’ve watched everything included. There’s quizzes at the end of each chapter to check your understanding of topics, which can sometimes be useful. Courses varied in length from between 30 minutes to hours, so it really depended on the course instructor how in depth you would get on a topic.\nThe quality of courses available on the sites varies a lot more than something like DataCamp. Some professors were great, while others were average at best. This is just more likely to happen with a site with thousands of courses available, as there’s fewer means for quality control.\nLinkedIn Learning was incredibly useful in getting me up to speed in the areas I wanted. I’d recommend it for anyone looking to upskill in Python, deep learning, and computer science best practices, as the content was quite strong in those realms. The business communication offerings were also very solid too. However, I would not recommend it as strongly for general data science, R and SQL upskilling, as the content was either more scarce, less detailed/useful, or more convoluted to implement.\n\n\nCoursera\nCoursera is most akin to a traditional college education experience. There are courses that have their own “week” of content associated, which includes lectures, readings, homework assignments, and/or quizzes.\nCoursera falls under the category of massive open online courses (MOOCs). I appreciate the democratization of knowledge that these courses offer, and I regularly audit online courses on sites like Coursera to find interesting readings and learn new topics.\nWhether or not Coursera will work for you depends on your learning style. I have never done well with academic-styled online courses, so I find Coursera more difficult to use for certification purposes than other methods. But some of the best professors from the most prestigious institutions are on the platform, so if that style of learning works well for you, the quality of education is easily available. I recommend researching the platform and other similar competitors like EdX and Udacity if that environment works well for you.\n\n\n365 Data Science\nI tried out 365 Data Science over the past month due to them offering all their content for free as a result of a recent rebranding. (If it wasn’t free, I would not have, to be completely honest.) I took the courses Data Strategy and Product Management for AI and Data Science, which were a few hours each. They had tracks for Business Analyst, Data Scientist, and Data Analyst, but given the limited time the service was available and my experience in the field already, there was less value in their course offerings for me than I would have gleaned a couple of years ago.\nTheir offerings are pretty high quality and the courses I took focused clearly on the business needs. Their offerings currently for the theoretical aspects of data science were there, but pretty scant. Their course offerings were focused on BI dashboarding tools (PowerBI, Tableau) and Python/SQL. There was not much love for R at all, so I would not recommend the service for anything beyond a cursory overview of the language."

    "text": "Buyer Beware: Bootcamps\nCoding and data science bootcamps have been popping up all over the place to meet the demand for data scientists in many industries. These are intensive 13-week long (or more) “live, eat, breathe, and sleep” data science experiences. I’ve interviewed some candidates who have gone through these bootcamps, and just based on the material I’ve heard these candidates talk about, they are not a be-all end-all solution to becoming a data scientist. I highly recommend that someone NOT take this avenue for learning to be a data scientist for these reasons:\n\nThey Don’t Teach the Right Material\nMany of these camps focus exclusively on machine learning and neural networks, which is not the core knowledge needed to succeed in data science. 80% of data science is cleaning your data and understanding business problems, which isn’t taught in a bootcamp. It’s unglamorous, but you will be using SQL more than you will be using deep learning.\nA statistics background is also underemphasized in many of these bootcamps, which leads to a poor return on investment. Sure, it’s a great project to put on a resume that you deployed a recurrent neural network model in TensorFlow through AWS, but if you can’t describe a p-value properly to someone, any company worth their salt won’t hire you as a data scientist.\n\n\nEmployers Can’t Validate A Bootcamp’s Quality\nBootcamps don’t carry the prestige that a traditional education path does. Employers barely look at a resume for 30 seconds, and if they did decide to validate an employee’s education quality, they could judge it on a site like US News and World (regardless of how flawed that may be). As that doesn’t exist for bootcamps, there’s no reputation gained from attending a bootcamp.\n\n\nThey’re Expensive and Predatory\nIn general, the cost of a bootcamp can be upwards of tens of thousands of dollars (basically near the cost of a state-school Master’s degree), but without the pedigree of a traditional post-secondary education. Some of these bootcamps can also be predatory with hiding their costs through Income Sharing Agreements, as this Twitter thread shows.\n\n\nWhat To Do Instead of a Bootcamp\nNow, I understand getting a full-time job as a data scientist after graduating can be nightmarish. (Entry-level jobs requiring 3-5 years of experience is its own rant.) I certainly didn’t have a full-time job lined up upon graduating after applying for 3 months prior, and instead applied to hundreds of places, hoping to find a place willing to take a chance. It took a lot of luck, a willingness on my part to move 12 hours away to a ‘less desirable’ location, and having some previous experience to get my foot in the door.\nThe lousy entry-level job market is what these for-profit bootcamps prey on, and they exploit vulnerable people with the promises of getting them the sexiest job of the 21st century. Bootcamps say they’ll help you with finding a job and mentorship, which can be very worth it to a lot of people on paper (and explains their vast popularity).\nHowever, the main value add with a bootcamp is building up a repository of projects to share with prospective employers. These projects can be developed and hosted on a personal Github page through self-learning or created by following a certification curriculum. So, unless you have a lot of disposable income, really believe in the mentorship that a bootcamp could provide, and believe that a bootcamp can get you a job upon finishing, I would not touch one with a 100-foot pole."

Why’s it amanda-park.github.io again?\nIn the past week, I saw a very disturbing Reddit post regarding Netlify and hosting websites. To give a short version of the story, websites hosted by Netlify could rack up thousands of dollars in bills for using excessive bandwidth beyond the free tier, and the Reddit post shows how this can happen (likely through DDoS attacks).\nUnsurprisingly, this scared the ever-loving crap out of me, and I promptly deleted my Netlify website and account. Even if it was nice to have a dedicated domain name for my portfolio/blog site, there was no way it outweighed the risk of having a $100k+ bill thrown my way. That’s why I’m back on github.io and hosting via Github Pages, and that will be the case going forward. (The domain name I had bought on Netlify and I didn’t see any easy way to transfer, so I considered that a sunk cost when I nuked my account.)\n\n\nWhy’s the blog look different?\nI could have theoretically used my previous site (built with Hugo and Blogdown in 2021) and just ported that to Github Pages. However, the site was a pain to make changes to in any meaningful manner as a result of its complexity. In the past couple of years, Quarto, my current blog platform of choice, had time to mature and make blogging much simpler than it had been previously.\nWhile it doesn’t have all the features I had in my previous platform (RIP Word Counts and Time to Read), it has enough of them and should be easily maintainable in the future. And as I’ve learned over the years, simple solutions are generally preferred over complex ones.\n\n\nWhat’s next?\nRight now I’m working on moving my old blog posts into this new site and fixing formatting issues/typos/etc. My blogging cadence has been very inconsistent once peak COVID passed, and I expect that to continue going forward. Blogging was a valuable lifeline for me in the era of social distancing and living alone, and I still want this site around for when I do have interesting things I might want to get out there somehow. However, I won’t force it.\nThanks for reading!"

I believe in science and the efficacy of the vaccines, so I had no hesitation getting the shot at the moment it was offered.

But a precaution, the nurses ask you to wait 15 minutes after obtaining the vaccine to make sure that no abnormal side effects occur.\nThis dose will lead to an incredibly sore arm you get the dose in (I chose to get it in my left arm, my non-dominant side). A couple days after the dose I felt moderate fatigue and a headache. After a good night’s rest though, those symptoms cleared up and I felt pretty normal.\n\n\nSecond Shot\nThis shot was definitely the more intense shot of the two. I felt symptoms after this dose within 24 hours. The day after the second dose I experienced an incredibly sore arm (the one I got the dose in), chills, widespread muscle and joint pain, fatigue, and headache. It was like the flu, and the following night I slept around 10 hours due to sheer exhaustion.\nHowever, after a good night’s rest I felt much better.

In the book, he discusses four principles:\nFor today’s post I’m going to focus on the first principle."

    "text": "Don’t lie, distort the data, or mislead the reader\nTo create ethical visualizations, the data needs to be presented in a fair way. That is, the representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface of the graphic itself, should be directly proportional to the number of quantities represented.\nTufte mathematically represented this idea with an equation called the Lie Factor. The Lie Factor is the size of the effect shown in a graphic divided by the size of the effect in the data. Values over 1 overstate the effect.\nNow all that may sound intimidating, but with a few pictures hopefully the idea will be clearer.\nBelow is a graphic that shows this in action:\n\n\n\nlie\n\n\nNotice the doctor’s width and height changes, which causes readers to be misled and think that the effect is much larger. In this visual, the lie factor is around 2.8. Here is another (what I consider more egregious) example:\n\n\n\nlie2\n\n\nNotice that the width difference highly distorts the actual change relative to the improvement that was seen. A 53% change looks much larger due to the drastically different size in the length of fuel effiency. If one looks solely at the lengths, it shows a 783% improvement!\n\nHow To Avoid This?\nFor both of these examples, if the effects were shown with a basic bar chart, the effect would not be distorted like this example. Clear labeling would also have helped these visuals to be more easily interpretable. For example, if we made a bar chart of the doctor example, label your y-axis with 0 as the starting point, plot the bars at the appropriate value for the value each doctor had in that year, and then keep the bar widths all the same. That alone would make the visual more accurate.\nIn general, be suspicious when graphs don’t start their y-value at 0 in something like bar graphs. Without having that frame of reference in a visual, the effect of a change will appear far larger than it actually is."

Plugins help to extend the functionality of the engine, and since RPG Maker is written in JavaScript, I’ve been relying on those who have made plugins to get my game to have some of the functionality it would otherwise not have.\n(I hope someday to learn JavaScript in order to make the “perfect” game I have in my head, but right now I’m professionally trying to learn Python and further develop my R skills.

I’ve always preferred turn-based RPGs anyway, so I didn’t feel a loss knowing that active-turn battle systems in RPG Maker generally didn’t work well. Through a plugin, I’ve changed the default battle system to allow for agility to influence turn order, which helped combat feel more dynamic. The characters in combat are based entirely off the characters that are in the D&D campaign, which made developing their combat skills and balancing them much easier.\nOverall, there are 5 characters, and they each play as follows:\n\nSorcerer: The protagonist. Magic DPS.\nCleric: Healer and tank\nWizard: Elemental magic damage and status effects\nRogue: AOE healing, turn order manipulation, status effects\nRanger: Physical DPS\n\nNormally in a JRPG there aren’t so many magical casters, let alone having two prioritize in shooting fire at things (which is what the Sorcerer and Cleric do in the actual D&D campaign). Their classes thankfully allowed for enough differentiation between the two, though in an ideal RPG I’d have each character have a unique primary element and then a secondary element they could train up. As a way to help buff up the wizard I gave him access to all the different elemental skills short of Holy magic, which offers him versatility in exploiting enemy weaknesses compared to the other characters. The Rogue was pretty underpowered until I gave her turn manipulation powers, which made her much more useful. And the Ranger just does the vast majority of the damage in the actual D&D campaign, so playing him like that made sense.\nIn general, through this journey something I’ve learned is that I work better when I have specific constraints set around me. Having to work with preset characters and make it work made things much faster than me trying to create new characters and balance them accordingly."

I would only consider my mapping skills average at this point, despite making a lot of maps, just because that design has had such a steep learning curve.\nHowever, something I feel like I’ve gotten much better at is creating cutscenes for the game. I’ve understood how to use events in RPG maker, conditional branches for character choices, and switches and variables to track game progress. It takes time to make a cutscene more compelling by adding in the little movements and reactions of characters, but I consider it worth it so the story is more likely to grab the player’s attention.\nThere’s certainly many other aspects needed to make a game feel whole beyond just creating good maps and cutscenes, and I’ve been trying to improve my skills there as well.

I’ve also structured my project in such a way that the code is more modular than in past projects and more of it is reusable. (Admittedly you can only do so much of this with RPG Maker, but I do it where I see the possibility.)\nHowever, I’ve still noticed some ways to make this process more efficient. I once again was sucked into scope creep, which made a project that should’ve just been a very simple RPG adventure turn into something much more interesting, but much more time-consuming. I have tried to mitigate these effects when I realize I’m considering doing something far too intensive, so it’s still a project I believe I can finish.

There a few main things you want to avoid when creating pixel art. (And if you want to know more, I highly recommend checking out Pixel Logic: A Guide to Pixel Art).\n\nJaggies\nWhen you draw in such a small scale, you need to watch out for how your lines are constructed, or else the line will look clunky. Jaggies occur when the length of lines makes a line you want to appear smooth look jagged instead. An example of what this looks like and how to fix it is below:\n\n\n\nSource: Pixel Logic\n\n\n\n\nBanding\nBanding happens when you try and shade an image perfectly around its border. This was something I intuitively did when I first started working with images and it made my art rough around the edges. Again, an example of what this looks like and how to avoid it is below. The biggest thing with banding is to try shading with different colors to avoid things looking blurry when zoomed out.\n\n\n\nSource: Pixel Logic\n\n\n\n\nAnti-Aliasing\nThe last point I found interesting in my pixel art journey (though there are many things) is anti-aliasing. It’s a technique meant to make pixel art easier to decipher by blurring pixels around a color transition. There are pros and cons to using anti-aliasing, so it depends on the specific sprite you’re working on whether or not you want to employ the technique.\n\n\n\nSource: Pixel Logic"

Being in the field of data science, I know that the best tools for tackling challenging problems are constantly evolving, so it’s basically a must that I continue to learn about new findings in the ever-expanding field of data analytics.\nOne thing my organization did recently that I am incredibly grateful for is offering unlimited access to a site called LinkedIn Learning. There are thousands of classes on there geared towards professional development, whether it be in a creative pursuit or something more technically minded.\nI’ve worked through a few different tracks that have been really helpful for developing my skills. Some of these have included: * Master Python for Data Science * Master the Fundamentals of AI and Machine Learning * Advance Your Skills in Deep Learning and Neural Networks\nEach learning path has its own set of courses included, and they generally focus on the practical skills you need to know in order to use it successfully in a professional setting. I appreciate the emphasis on practicality rather than the theoretical underpinnings that regularly motivated my formal education experiences.\nSo why am I making this post? I just want to encourage you to also invest in yourself. There are going to be more careers than not that will be impacted by the technological revolution of AI, so if you’re not in a direct person-facing role odds are higher than not that your job will be at risk of being partially (or fully) automated.\nFurther, this investment doesn’t need to be anything intimidating, either. 10 minutes a day, if done on a consistent basis, will lead to some pretty solid results when measured out over the course of a year. It gets easier if you do it every day, but doing it every day is the hard part."

    "text": "2024 Update: I don’t use JIRA nor SAFe for managing my work, I just track my work with a Kanban board and keep things simple.\nPrior to getting my current position, I had never used any sort of task management software. My schedule was generally driven by school demands, whether it be through assignment deadlines or the times during the week that class ran. Task management was very fluid to the needs of whatever assignment or exam was next, so I never saw the benefit of using a structured tool to manage what I needed to do.\nHowever, that all changed when my workplace shifted towards using an Agile process for tracking work. I at first resisted the idea, finding it to waste time and add bureaucratic bloat. While I still have my gripes about the challenges in implementing the methodology in a large-scale organization, in practice it works well for organizing thoughts and projects on a small-scale.\nIf you’re unfamiliar with Agile, the idea is that large projects can be broken up into tasks. These tasks can be assigned an effort score. The creators of SAFe, a large-scaled implementation of Agile, suggest scoring based on the amount of days you think the project will take to complete.\nHowever, these effort scores can be defined how you wish; for personal projects I prefer to break down how long a task will take by the amount of hours rather than days.\nNext comes the prioritization. Ideally you have a few different tasks to do. You focus on the ones that bring the highest value and have a strict deadline first. There are two common ways of organizing tasks:"

    "section": "How I Use Agile for Personal Projects",
    "text": "How I Use Agile for Personal Projects\nIt took me a while to wrap my head around Agile practices at work and to see the benefit in having that structure, as it’s very dense due to its origins from optimizing software development. So do not feel bad if the words Scrum and Kanban sound more like Klingon than actual English words. After over a year of using Agile methodologies at work, here’s how I’ve used them in my personal life to my benefit:\n\n1) Find an Agile Software and Create a Project/Board\nAdmittedly, I became used to JIRA because that is what my workplace uses for project management. But I know that early on I found myself very overwhelmed by JIRA and all the different options that it had. There are other tools such as Trello that may be easier for a beginner to start with. Hopefully the general advice below is still helpful for thinking about how to organize a personal project!\nWhether you decide to go with JIRA, Trello, or another task management tool, be sure to create a project to store your tasks in. I named my project “Personal Goals”, but if you want to focus on something narrower that is also possible.\nIf you’re using JIRA, here you can also choose if you want to have a Kanban project or a Scrum project; I recommend experimenting to see which approach works better for you, but I found that Scrum projects better fit my needs. If you’re using Trello your boards will be Kanban boards.\n\n\n2) Create a Backlog of Tasks\nThe next thing you need to know is what you need to do. Documenting all the different things you need to do can take up a good chunk of time, but by writing it down I don’t forget all the things I want to do a couple of weeks later.\n\n\n3) Create User “Epics” to Organize Your Backlog of Tasks\nBecause my project is focused on Personal Goals, I am able to break down the things I want to learn and do into certain categories. For me, these include categories such as: * Game Development * Learning Python * Personal Development\nIf there are clear categories of things you need to do and a roadmap of skills you want to build, breaking down tasks into categories will be very helpful.\nIf you’re using Trello, it may be helpful to instead keep separate boards to organize your tasks with, as the option for traditional Epics doesn’t exist in the same way.\n\n\n4) Organize Tasks Into Sprints (Scrum) or In a General To-Do Order (Kanban)\nAt first, I tried following the Kanban approach of continuously getting tasks done when I had time, but found the approach a bit overwhelming. I think I would have succeeded had I created an order to go after tasks in Kanban rather than just leave any and every task up for grabs, so I suggest doing that if you consider the Kanban board approach.\nHowever, I eventually switched to a project on JIRA with a Scrum setup instead, where I could organize my work into two-week sprints. This helped a lot with the feelings of being swamped with things to do. Within these two-week sprints, you can assign a certain amount of points that you expect yourself to do. How many points you assign depends on how you quantify said points. For example, if 1 point equals a day’s worth of work, SAFe methodology says you shouldn’t assign more than 8 points of work to be done throughout the sprint.\nBecause I follow a different scoring system for personal projects, I try to give myself a set number of hours available for getting tasks done, and then put tasks into the sprint accordingly to fit those needs. When I have a moment where I want to get something done, I consult the Scrum board for that sprint and choose a task to complete.\n\n\n5) Check In Regularly to Review Progress\nIf you’re using Scrum, you have a natural checkpoint to evaluate the work you have completed once a sprint is over. If you use Kanban, you’ll have to make a note to check in every now and again to evaluate how you’re progressing on your goals.\nThese checkpoints are great because they allow you to iterate on your process and confirm how much work you have completed. Before managing my tasks, I felt like I didn’t accomplish much most days. But by using software that showed my progress, it was easier to quantify and see what I had done. And with each sprint, it’s easier for me to clarify what I truly want to work on right now and thus reach my goals."

There’s no one template for this approach, as each situation is different and each person’s reactions to a crisis will vary. There are a few different generalized responses to a crisis, though:\n\nThree General Responses to Crisis\nEustress - a person in this group generally is functional after a crisis and can take care of their needs with little to no emotional suffering\nDistress - this group is generally able to get done what needs to get done, but there’s an obvious emotional strain that wears on them.\nDysfunction - this group is not able to get their basic needs met and is psychologically impaired.\n\n\nDifference Between Distress and Dysfunction\nIt can be hard to distinguish between distress and dysfunction. A person may only be in temporary distress and then function fine after a certain period of time, or they may regress into a dysfunctional state. There are a few domains that can be looked at to determine whether a person is in distress or dysfunction:\nCognitive - distress may manifest as temporary confusion, inability to concentrate, and being overwhelmed; dysfunction can manifest as hopelessness, suicidal thoughts, and hallucinations.\nEmotional - distress may manifest as fear, anxiety, sadness, and anger; dysfunction may manifest as panic attacks, immobilizing depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nBehavioral - distress may manifest as disturbances in eating and sleeping patterns and being easily startled; dysfunction may manifest as reclusiveness and self-medication.\nSpiritual - distress may involve a questioning of one’s faith; dysfunction may include projecting one’s faith onto others or abandoning religion entirely.\nPhysiologic - distress may manifest as a change in appetite or libido, dysfunction may manifest as a change in either cardiac or gastrointestinal function.\nBy looking at all these different domains you can see a general trend of when someone may be in distress compared to being in dysfunction."

This includes an inability to perform self-care, acting hopeless, and a reduced awareness of the consequences of one’s actions.\nRisk-based triage focuses on three D’s: whether a person was forced to confront death (whether threatened with it or having to see human remains), dislocation (whether separated from loved ones or a place to call home), and disabling impact (whether there was a physical injury or dissociation).\nOf course, risk-based triage can help to guide an approach, but it should be combined with evidence-based triage to obtain the best results."

A general outline that can be followed as a script is:\n\nIntroduce self and explain your presence\nAsk about the person’s well-being\nAsk about the situation\nClarify ambiguity along the way (ie, when a person says they’re depressed, what exactly do they mean?)\n\nAfter going through that script, there are generally two ways to approach an intervention. If the person appears psychologically unstable (example: they’re having a panic attack), the main goal to focus on is stabilization. This can be done through using distraction and clearing the situation of any triggering cues. However, if the person appears to be stable but in acute distress, approaches such as reframing, reassurance, and normalization of feelings can be effective."

However, if it seems multiple follow-ups are needed to see how someone is doing, that’s when further professional care would be of assistance.\nHowever, after this if a person does not seem able to function independently, then immediate access to further support is necessary, and the most appropriate support varies depending on the specific situation."

Further, it got me into some bad habits coding-wise, so frequently my code (while it was functional) was a pain to follow logically.\nIf I had used R Markdown from the start and just submitted files that way (though I’m not sure if my program would have allowed it), I would have saved a LOT of time. I had to screenshot way too many outputs from R and insert them into LaTeX, but R allows you to embed both numeric outputs and images into an exported PDF and/or HTML file. Further, since Markdown is much easier to format and understand than LaTeX, writing up assessments on assignments would have been much easier.\nIn my current job, I don’t create reports or assessments through R Markdown - I mostly just use it as a way to organize my coding thoughts so it’s easier for others to follow along.

I wrote code ad-hoc for assignments basically all the time, and it became a habit to just copy-paste code when assignments had overlapping uses. Each question in an assignment was different enough that the process couldn’t be standardized in any meaningful way.\nNow that I’ve been learning about software development and best practices associated with that, I realize just how wasteful and inefficient a lot of my previous code was. I’ve been learning about how Python is an object-oriented programming language, and while it’s not natural for me to think about coding things in classes just yet (especially in R, since classes are much different there), I now see obvious opportunities to make my code more reusable for future asks.

According to Robin Dunbar, a leading researcher in this space, people tend to have anywhere between 100 - 250 friends (with the average being 150) in their social network. And this doesn’t just mean those that you have met once and then added on social media; this is supposed to represent the amount of people that you are at least casual friends with (so it’s excluding acquaintances).\nNow, I’m an introvert, and I find that number of people you’re supposed to be friends with downright intimidating. While I have had that number of people present on various social media accounts in the past, I know a substantial percentage of those adds were either acquaintances, coworkers, or otherwise not connected. I felt like I was missing something important when I saw just what the “ideal” friend breakdown was:\n\n2 special friends\n5 intimate friends\n15 best friends\n50 good friends\n150 friends\n500 acquaintances\n\nWhen I first saw this breakdown I was very surprised to find levels beyond best friend being quantified. I started realizing that being a “good friend” to the people I felt closest to might not have meant as much as I had thought previously.\nAccording to this 2016 study, less than half of all friendships are reciprocal. So you might think someone is a good friend for you, but you barely are a blip on their radar. It’s somewhat more likely that a friendship is reciprocal if there is are shared friends in your respective social circles, and it is less likely if the friend self-describes as already having a lot of friends.\nOf course, there’s a limit on how many relationships a person alone can juggle, given that there are only 24 hours in a day. A person can want to be best friends with thousands of people, but they will fail in that objective simply because they cannot find the time to support those relationships in a meaningful manner. And if they try to fit in that many friendships, while their social network will be very wide, it will also be shallower by default.\nThe amount of relationships a person can have also will be dependent on their life situation. If someone is working full-time and going to school full-time, there isn’t going to be time to maintain nearly as many, nor nearly as close of, friendships compared to someone with a freer schedule. People may also struggle to make friends if they:\n\nAre neurodiverse and/or disabled\nLack interpersonal skills\nAre shy and/or socially anxious\nHave an insecure attachment style\nAre living in a different culture than they grew up in\n\nIt can be rough going if you feel you have the deck stacked against you with regards to friendships. So that got me on the case of researching just what was necessary to build those connections that were rewarding and long-lasting."

    "section": "Keys to Building Closer Friendships",
    "text": "Keys to Building Closer Friendships\nAccording to Shasta Nelson, there are three key tenets to having and maintaining closer friendships:\n\nConsistency\nVulnerability\nPositivity\n\n\nConsistency\nConsistency is relatively straightforward. Maintaining regular contact is necessary to get to know a person better, or else it will be easy to drift apart. But it’s the hardest part to stick to when you’re an adult juggling various responsibilities. When you’re growing up in school or in college, there are more opportunities to “put in the time” to make lifelong friendships, but less so when you’re working a full-time job.\nSome things you can do to make sure your friendships are consistent include:\n\nInitiate hangouts\nIt may be challenging for the anxious and introverted to organize social events, but they are the secret to making sure that the aforementioned hours get put in to build closeness. But if that seems too bold, you can rely on…\n\n\nScheduling a recurring hangout\nThis can be tied to a specific interest, whether it be book club, D&D, or something other shared interest.\n\n\nBe patient\nYou can’t have someone become a best friend overnight. This study shows it takes ~50 hours to have an acquaintance become a casual friend, ~90 hours to become a regular friend, and ~200 hours to have someone be a good friend. Much like there isn’t a quick scheme to lose 20 pounds overnight, it’s going to take some time to actually make a friend.\n\n\nDon’t let perfect be the enemy of good enough\nI much prefer having hangouts where the group size is 4 or fewer, as that gives you the opportunity to go deeper and ask more meaningful questions. However, it can be easier to see more friends and catch up in one shot if you are able to meet up in larger groups. There are pros and cons to each approach – be willing to do each, even if it’s not the “ideal” state to make friends in.\n\n\nPrioritize a few friends\nIf you’re in the process of trying to build friendships with people, try to focus on making sure they are hung out with consistently first rather than trying to do it with everybody. It will be more sustainable in the long run and you can reap the rewards more consistently.\n\n\n\nVulnerability\nVulnerability has been something I’ve struggled with in the past. Brene Brown’s research emphasizes the importance of being vulnerable in forming lasting connections, but it can be terrifying to be open with your emotions with others. The process of vulnerability needs to be gradual as you hang out with a person more regularly; if you go straight into talking about your deepest traumas with a person there’s a high probability that you will scare them off due to poor boundaries. However, if you never open up to a person despite hanging out regularly you may get stuck in acquaintance/friend territory with no opportunity for further closeness as you are labeled as aloof or uncaring.\nSome things you can do to increase vulnerability in friendships include:\n\nKnowing Yourself\nAre you able to own what you’re feeling? Can you tell others your real feelings, and do you do it on a consistent basis? How often do you ask for what you need from others?\n\n\nInitiating Ideas\nIt can be exciting to do something different together with friends. Are you comfortable suggesting as much?\n\n\nExpanding Conversations\nAre you able to ask good follow-up questions when a person is sharing? And are you able to share thoughtfully when asked to reflect on something?\n\n\nTalking about the tough stuff\nAre you able to go to your friends with shameful feelings, life stresses, and insecurities? Are you a safe space for them to share back those same things?\n\n\nTalking about the good stuff\nCan you give compliments to others and lift them up? Can you accept when others compliment you without dismissing it?\n\n\n\nPositivity\nPositivity can be a thing that makes or breaks friendships. The idea is that there needs to be at least 5 positive interactions for every 1 negative interaction. If a friendship regularly devolves into gossip or doomscrolling about the state of the world, it can be difficult to foster feelings of positivity and get closer to the person. This is what can make depression so insidious for friendship quality - your thoughts generally skew negative when you’re depressed, and that can subtly indicate to others that they should back away, which can make the depressed person lonelier and subsequently even more depressed.\nSome things you can do to increase positivity in friendships include:\n\nGive Generously and Smartly\nBeing a giving person is generally a positive character trait; however, in the wrong situation, this trait can be abused by a toxic friend. Having some awareness as to who would benefit from your generosity, how they would best benefit from your giving and when to do it will get you a lot farther than blindly offering up to do nice things to people with no rhyme or reason.\n\n\nUnderstand How Your Friends Give and Receive\nAccording to Gary Chapman there are 5 main love languages people use to express their affection to another. They are:\n\nPhysical touch\nActs of service\nQuality time\nGifts\nWords of affirmation\n\nEvery person will feel loved based on some combination of the above. Learning your friends’ love languages will help you understand how they show they care, and help you help them be happier overall. (You won’t waste time getting an expensive gift for someone who prefers quality time, for example.)\n\n\nAdmit Your Needs\nTo let a friendship truly shine, you need to be able to let your friends help you when you need something. (This is one I personally struggle with, as I prefer to try and solve things on my own to start.) If you are unsure of your needs, some common needs people have include:\n\nConnection – includes acceptance, safety, trust, respect, intimacy, belonging, and more\nPhysical well-being – includes food, water, air, shelter, sleep, touch, and more\nAutonomy – includes choice, freedom, space, and more\n\nIt is okay to allow friends to help you meet your needs, especially as the friendship grows and you become closer."

    "section": "Less Controllable Factors in Maintaining Friendships",
    "text": "Less Controllable Factors in Maintaining Friendships\nThere were some other things I found as being helpful in making friends in my reading, such as:\n\nCommitment\nProximity\nCompatibility\n\n\nCommitment\nCommitment basically represents the amount of effort each party is willing to put into the friendship. You can be positive, vulnerable, and consistent with a potential friend all that you want, but ultimately friendship is a two-way street. If a friend doesn’t reciprocate that effort, then there’s nothing you can do to change that – the level of a friendship will default to whichever party puts the least amount of effort into.\n\n\nProximity\nProximity represents how close physically you are to a potential friend. When I had moved out to Michigan for my job back in 2019, it was much harder to maintain connections with friends from grad school when I was 12 hours away compared to being in the same town. With the advent of the internet it’s still possible to not skip a beat with texts, calls, and video chats, but it’s not quite the same as meeting someone in-person for an activity, and it can be very challenging to build connections when your avenue for doing so is entirely virtual. This fact alone (alongside Tim Urban’s WaitButWhy article The Tail End) motivated me to move closer to home in 2021 (with my job’s blessing to let me work fully remote).\n\n\nCompatibility\nCompatibility is the secret sauce that determines how well you get along with somebody else. This can include values, communication style, and more. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach that determines this (despite what astrology tests might have you believe), so you’ll know it when you see it.\n\n\nParasocial Relationships\nI want to make a note about this, as I feel like the internet makes lonely people especially susceptible to this one. There are a lot of people on the internet nowadays that make their living as some sort of influencer. Perhaps they make YouTube videos, maybe they stream video games on Twitch, or they might be on the TikTok train. The venue doesn’t really matter.\nWhat matters is that a lot of them try to give you a sense that you are “behind the scenes” of their lives in a way that celebrities pre-internet did not do. On these sites, you can communicate directly with the person through comments and messages, and they might respond in a way that seems friendly. This can be effectively bought on a lot of platforms by donating money to the content creator, as someone who donates will be much more likely to read off a message as opposed to a random, free message out into the ether.\nAs you can guess, this isn’t a meaningful connection at all. It may feel special to the person who’s watching the content creator/celebrity, but beyond a general “thank you” message to the fans, the fan doesn’t stand out in any meaningful way from the crowd. This leaves the door wide open to make a quick buck on a person’s loneliness, which explains the profitability for content creators on general social media sites. However, that also justifies the success of OnlyFans, a platform which offers an even more intimate view into a person’s life for the right price.\nIt is very unlikely that you will ever be an acquaintance of, let alone befriend, a highly-popular content creator. The younger generation in particular needs to be warned to not mistake the connection they feel as being reciprocated in any way. There is the appearance of the right variables for connection in content being produced nowadays, which can put unsuspecting people at risk of becoming too attached and further trying to meet their need for connection in unhealthy ways.\nBasically, know what you’re getting into with content creators. They’re about as close to you as movie stars. Don’t be fooled otherwise."

Use bolding, saving only the useful information, and/or executive summaries to not end up with too much information\n\nTip: Large Language Models (LLMs) are great for summarizing large pieces of text into executive summaries\n\nExpress what you have learned with the world in some way (like posting on a blog)\n\n📹 Time Tracking - Use either a paid or open-source tool (I recommend ActivityWatch) to automatically monitor how you’re spending your time.

Useful if it’s really difficult to get started for whatever reason\n1️⃣ Single Tasking - Focus on one task (your most important task) without distractions to interrupt you\n🔲 Time Blocking - plan your day in half hour blocks, make list of tasks that need to be done (schedule in half-hour blocks), and include flexible time blocks to protect against unforeseen tasks\n\n🗓️ Ideal Week Calendar - Consider what an ideal week would look like for you, and block out reasonable times for your top priorities on a separate calendar in Google Calendar. Focus on current ideal ordinary week and future ideal ordinary week\n👀 Year at a Glance - Look at your calendar with the days measured vertically and each month as a column, so you can more easily digest what you have planned throughout the year and various accomplishments.\n\nTip: use relevant emojis if you want to track habits each day in a quick visual manner; for example, 🏋️‍♀️ can represent exercising on a specific day\n\n\n🐫 Two List Method - create up to 25 goals, circle the top 5 you actually want to achieve, and the other 20 goals are in the “Avoid At All Costs” list."

The key assumption is that you can live off a 4% withdrawal rate from your investments, living off the principal in perpetuity.\nBasic tenets:\n\nIncrease your savings rate. While the math is somewhat oversimplified, the general tenet of this article holds and shows how much increasing your savings rate can reduce the years needed to retire.\n\nCalculate your current savings rate with this calculator\n\nTax-deferred accounts can reduce the years needed to retire (given current US tax laws, at least); see this article. Basically, save as much money as you feasibly can in retirement vehicles such as a 401(k), IRA, and Health Savings Account (HSA) before using a taxable brokerage account\n\nVariations of FIRE:\n\nCoast FIRE - You save up enough in your retirement accounts that you as long as you meet your current living expenses with an additional source of income, you can retire by your desired age\nBarista FIRE - Ggenerate a small amount of income to greatly reduce the net worth needed to leave a full-time job\nLean FIRE - You’re okay living more frugally in retirement\nFat FIRE - You want to live a luxurious lifestyle in retirement\n\nNote:\n\nIf in the USA, you will want at least 10 years (40 quarters) paying into Social Security and Medicare taxes to be eligible for both at retirement age.

To put it bluntly, the growth mindset purports to celebrate failure when in actual fact it does completely the opposite.\n\n\nThis level of control can be a means to reduce feelings of inferiority and shame.

Interestingly, depressed people are better at judging the accuracy of the world; humans have a bias towards the positive (narcissistic idiocy). However this doesn’t contribute to a healthy mindset.\nSigns of depression:\n\nCognitive biases\n\nNegative interpretation of ambiguous events\nInability to abandon negative beliefs about self\nSelection bias towards the negative\nOvergeneralization of memories\n\nSocial withdrawal\nAnhedonia\nPhysical symptoms\n\nDisrupted sleep\nWeight loss or gain\nFatigue or loss of energy\n\nEmotional symptoms\n\nPoor concentration or indecisiveness\nExtreme irritability or chronic anger\n\nWatching the same shows over and over again because of already knowing the outcome and not needing to worry about the emotional investment\n\nManaging:\n\nPractice emotional awareness and processing\n\nLet go of the shame of not being able to solve your emotional problems, which can exacerbate the depression\nSee depression as separate from yourself, not who you inherently are\n“You can be happy and sad. You can be an individual while still being a part of a community. You can feel grateful and displeased.”\n\nHealthy habits\n\nEat right\nStay hydrated\nExercise\nMeditate\nGet 8 hours of sleep\nBe in nature\nJournal\n\nManage Cognitive Biases\n\nHow we feel is not evidence that these thoughts are true - “It’s only a thought, it’s not any more powerful than a thought about how the milk is running low.”\n\nDevelop promotion goals (making good things happen) over prevention goals (avoiding bad things)\nBuild strong social ties through volunteering or clubs if your social circle is weak\nUnderstand the beliefs associated with the Ideal Self (who you want to be), Actual Self (who you are), and the “Should Be” Self (what you feel you must do)\nSet realistic expectations - aim for content and not happy\n\n“You don’t have to be hopeful about the future. It’s enough to just be curious about what will happen next.”\n\nAddress demoralization and helplessness in therapy\nKnow that hating or loving yourself is a choice\nWith anhedonia, continue doing things even if the “want” isn’t there\n“There’s a very fine line between being in a groove and being in a rut.”\nPractice sense foraging. Focus on experiencing body sensations rather than numbing out to the internet/TV/etc. Muting body inputs can make feelings of depression persist longer, like a piece of software that hasn’t updated"

Effectively, shame is the gap between who we are (current self) and what we want and/or believe we should be (ideal self), and needs shame, secrecy, and judgment to thrive.\nSigns it’s present include thinking you’re never good enough, not worthy of love and belonging, questioning why you feel you deserve these things in arrogance, and having emotional flashbacks.\nManaging:\n\nBe aware of shame and name it when it occurs for you\nUnderstand the origins of shame and how it happened to you as a young child\nPractice self-compassion\nAcknowledge the different parts of yourself\nShare in the context of safe relationships\nThe fact that you are high functioning doesn’t mean that you are easier for you to deal with, it means it’s easier for others to deal with you.\nBe mindful of “leaky feelings”, where there is incongruence between your inner state, awareness, and behavior. This can be addressed through shadow work and understanding what you’re most shameful of, as that is what is most likely to “leak” out\n\n\n🌆 Systemic Shame\nThere is also the shame that is built into society, coined by Dr. Devon Price as Systemic Shame. The core values of Systemic Shame include:\n\nPerfectionism: Only endless, flawless work and accomplishment matters.\nIndividualism: Everything that we do we do completely alone.\nConsumerism: Who we are is what we buy and own. Wealth: The only power that matters is economic power over others. Personal responsibility: Change only happens through personal willpower and strength.\n\nThere are three levels:\n\nPersonal Shame - feelings of self-loathing over identity, limitations, or perceived failings. Leads to hiding yourself from others/avoidant tendencies, leading to interpersonal shame. Heal personal shame by practicing radical acceptance, including:\n\nTelling others what you’re feeling\nAdmitting when hard work and struggle is going nowhere\nIndulge in desires that have always been there but are considered socially taboo\nLive as a person that others might dislike, and not caring what they think\n\nInterpersonal Shame - believing other people are unsafe/untrustworthy, and people are generally immoral. Leads to harshly judging the actions of others, being hyperindependent, focusing only on self-preservation/safety, and not accepting help from others. Heal interpersonal shame by practicing expansive recognition:\n\nNoticing when you view someone’s actions in the worst possible light and asking why.\nSpeaking up when needs are in conflict of those of a loved one, so the bond can be repaired.\nThinking a lot about other people’s positions (economic, cultural, legal, etc.) make their lives different than your own.\nSurround yourself with people that make being “you” feel natural and safe.\n\nGlobal Shame - believing humanity is filled with selfish, apathetic, or morally “bad” people, feeling humanity isn’t even worth saving. Leads to being cynical and not trying to improve relationships or the community. Heal global shame by having hope for humanity:\n\nTrust in the inner voice/conscience that tells you what is right.\nAbandon pursuits that you were trained to value but don’t really believe in.\nAppreciate the potential of where you are and finding opportunity to make a difference right where you are.\nBuild connection in the local neighborhood/community to feel a part of something greater."

I was daunted by the realization that I had never spent a moment of true interpersonal comfort with anyone.\nLoneliness can be described in different ways; a commonly used measure of loneliness, the UCLA Loneliness Scale, asks individuals about a range of feelings or deficits of connection, including how often they feel:\n\nthey lack companionship\nleft out\n“in tune” with people around them\noutgoing and friendly\nthere are people they can turn to\n\nTypes of loneliness:\n\nNew-Situation Loneliness - change in location, job, etc.\nI’m Different Loneliness - feeling fundamentally different from others\nIntimate Loneliness - lacking close relationships\nPet Loneliness - lacking a pet\nNo Time for You Loneliness - people who are friendly but don’t want to, have time to, or don’t want to prioritizing, becoming or maintaining a friendship\nRelational (Casual Friends) Loneliness - lacking depth and ability to confide/trust others\nQuiet Presence Loneliness - not having someone to hang out with at home to know they’re “there”\n\nSigns of Loneliness:\n\nOversharing when someone is listening\nFeeling disposable in a group\nPutting other people’s needs above your own\nFeeling need to be overly helpful or nice\nFeeling isolated and like nobody sees you\nFeeling like you don’t belong anywhere\nBecoming obsessive with friendships\n\nManaging:\n\nGet a hold of it before it gets too bad if possible.

This means participating in communities, chatting about topics you care about, give advice on forums, have video calls with friends, and share vulnerably online.\nRespond reasonably when talking with others\n\nDon’t respond curtly or hog the conversation\nAsk others about their lives and opinions\nDon’t confess your faults and insecurities to those you just met\n\n\nPractice healthy habits\n\nDetermine specific discomfort with being alone\nRemember observability bias - you encounter solitude frequently, but never encounter other people’s.\nGive others benefit of the doubt, and don’t take friendly ribbings too personally\nDon’t compare yourself to someone’s highlight reel\nShare good things when they happen in the present moment\nSpend more time in nature and away from screens\nDon’t use defensive body language (folding arms over chest, hands in pocket, looking at phone)\n\nAdopt a pet\nEnjoy being alone\n\nPursue hobbies and things only you want to do\nTake yourself out on a date and focus on things that your best days consisted of, what you stopped doing for no reason, and made hours fly by\n\n“I need to find a partner, I don’t want to be alone”. She rephrased that at the end of one session, “I want to find a partner, I don’t need to be alone.”\n\nDifferentiate taking time for yourself (conscious choice) and self-isolation (driven by fear)\n\n“There is a difference between being lonely and being alone. Learn to embrace and enjoy the latter and the former will fade away.”\n\n\nUse nostalgia to give your life meaning again\n\nLonely people often feel like side characters in their own lives with a lack of meaning or direction; nostalgia can help to recenter the narrative"

You can’t pretend to be grateful for something you know is wrong for you - you’ll neither feel good about it nor get the positive effects of actual gratitude. Example: “I guess I’m glad I have a little money in the bank.”\nTragic gratitude - recognizing there are many things to be grateful for, but also recognizing things could be a lot better. You don’t have to pretend things are better than they are, because true gratitude isn’t fake it ’til you make it. Example: “I’m grateful I’ve saved a little money, I need to come up with a plan to start saving more.”\n\nPractice:\n\nSay thank you or write a thank-you note\nGive a gift\nVerbalize appreciation\nDo something thoughtful\nIf writing down what you’re grateful for is tough, find things you approve of and write about them that way.

Generally used to let go of perfectionism.\nInvolves the following:\n\nSelf-kindness and practicing non-judgment: being kind and understanding toward yourself.\n\nEx: It’s okay that you failed that test. It was really hard; Emotions and thoughts are morally neutral, and it’s okay to just let them be.\n\nMindfulness and avoiding over-identification: having a balanced reaction to painful thoughts and feelings, not underreacting or overreacting.\n\nEx: I notice I’m feeling sad right now; I am stuck in a difficult situation and doing my best to make it through; My “worst” impulses do not define me as a person.\n\nCommon humanity and avoiding isolation: seeing one’s experience as part of the larger human experience.\n\nEx: Everyone fails from time to time; Other people are found COVID lockdowns difficult to follow; If you find safe people to confide in, you’d feel less alone\n\n\nChallenges:\n\nBackdraft - when you try to be compassionate to yourself but end up feeling worse (this is a normal thing to have happen)\nInsecure attachment styles cause fear/aversion to self-compassion\n\nContentment system is weaker (can’t rely on past memories of support to self-soothe)\nHighly active threat detection systems cause children to see need for compassion as a sign they are weak, so they resist any expression of compassion due to concerns of being rejected, harshly criticized, or feeling undeserving.\n\nPractice behavioral self-compassion when the fear of self-compassion is high. This means focusing on what is needed in the moment, like taking a break from work when stressed, rather than mental exercises.\n\nWhat do I need to feel safe? To be comforted, soothed, validated?

So too was talk about hopes, dreams, and accomplishments.\nVulnerability is what you experience when you take a risk, or leave yourself open to emotional harm.

What makes a person worthy, what does worthiness mean, and worthy of what?\n\nIf there are specific criteria, like “you have to be financially independent and be married,” ask “Does this apply to everybody, or just to you?”\n\nIf this criteria represents your core beliefs, develop a realistic strategy to meet those goals and become worthy.\nInstead, if you realize you’re clinging to a rigidity that you don’t actually believe in, remember brains can confuse feelings for facts.

And she asked me to say qualities about myself that someone else would be attracted to, on a romantic and platonic level. So I mentioned some things like compassionate, empathetic and she said, “You named things that you can give someone; ways you can serve, rather than ways that you are.” And my mind was blown. That’s going to stick with me forever. She then proceeded to tell me actual innate qualities about myself that she liked and thought anyone else would like as well and I hadn’t even considered those because, like she said, I was focused on things I could do outwardly to attract and maintain connections rather than who I was as a person.\nCan be conflated with self-esteem, which is a more transient version. Instead of focusing on specific traits, skills, circumstances, or achievements, self-worth describes the core beliefs you have about your worth and value.\nPeople with high self-worth:\n\nBelieve that they are good, worthy, and lovable regardless of what’s happening in life\nFeel deserving of love and respect from others\nAccept and love yourself now with no conditions or exceptions\nPractice self-compassion and treat yourself with kindness, care, and respect\nBelieve in your potential to grow, learn, change, and improve\nHave flaws and make mistakes that don’t threaten your identity or worth\n\nSigns of low self-worth:\n\nConditional self-worth; only being worthy if your relationships, appearance, net worth, career, or achievements are X.\n\nJob/career can just be a way to make money, not your life or identity\n\nFeeling inherently undeserving of love and belonging and deserving suffering\nFear that developing self-worth will stop motivation to grow/change, lead to arrogance, or that it’s just impossible to cultivate\nWhen you use the words “I should…”, you’re silently finishing the sentence with “…in order to be worthy of love and respect.”\n\nCauses:\n\nNegative experiences in early childhood (including repeated little t traumas)\nNegative core beliefs\nStressful life events\n\nTreatment:\n\nUnderstand where the low self-worth criteria comes from. What makes a person worthy, what does worthiness mean, and worthy of what?\n\nIf there are specific criteria, like “you have to be financially independent and be married,” ask “Does this apply to everybody, or just to you?”\n\nIf this criteria represents your core beliefs, develop a realistic strategy to meet those goals and become worthy.\nInstead, if you realize you’re clinging to a rigidity that you don’t actually believe in, remember brains can confuse feelings for facts. So feeling undeserving can lead to your brain justifying your low self-worth, even if it doesn’t align with your beliefs. Approach the issue on a metacognitive level.\n\n\nRemember that everyone has flaws and imperfections, flaws connect us and make us interesting, and if someone had been through what you’ve been through, they’d likely have the same flaws.\nAs uncomfortable as it might be, what if, that is just how and who you are?\n\n”What is the constant point of your life? I am a doctor but I am also a mother, the former can change at any time but the latter will never change. So who are you and what is the never-changing point of your life? What is it that will never change even if the worst comes to happen?”"

Don’t treat the task as an uphill boulder that’s boring or meaningless; try to think of how to make the task more energizing.\n\nManage:\n\nDon’t wait for motivation - do it anyway\nSit quietly (free from distraction) and think for 15 minutes about what you’re going to do (prevents avoidance behaviors, gives anxiety chance to abate)\nBreak down tasks into tiny, bite sized pieces, and mark progress with smaller tasks\nDo low effort, crappy versions of task as often as you can to “lower the stakes”\nMake distractions the primary task and the primary task as the side task"

    "text": "😰 Anxiety\nNote - I’m not considering feeling anxious as the same as something like Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). This is meant for more day to day anxiety people experience.\n“When you get anxious, your amygdala is activated. You can tell yourself that you’re okay and even logically understand you are okay, but your amygdala isn’t catching up yet. Just remember that you are okay, and it’s just your amygdala needing time to adjust (10-15 minutes).”\n“You’ll stop worrying what others think about you when you realize how seldom they do.” - David Foster Wallace\nAnxiety, simply put, is concern about the unknown and/or future. It’s feeling like we’re not in control — we don’t know what’s going to happen, so we imagine the worst.\n\nThe opposite of anxiety is not relaxation, but prosocial behavior.\nExtreme anxiety, such as a panic attack, are not physically dangerous to experience, just deeply unpleasant\n\nTypes of anxiety:\n\nFunctional anxiety - gives important information to the brain\nDeath anxiety - fear of death and dying\n\nFear of both the known and unknown\nComing close to death brings about growth and positive life transformation\nAcceptance of death is not the same as giving up on life, but allows for meaning to be brought to life\n\nPerformance anxiety - fear of faltering in front of others\nSocial anxiety - fear of disapproval in social situations\n\nDon’t excessively monitor yourself as that gives the wrong impression to others; how you feel inside is not how you look to others\nRemember spotlight effect - people are too self-absorbed to think about you\nDon’t tell yourself you have to perform perfectly, creates impossible standards\nDon’t use alcohol to treat social anxiety\nPerceived inadequacies are not tied to a fundamental lack of social skills\nFor fear of missing out (FOMO):\n\nDo a digital detox\nGet more quality time in loved ones\nPractice meditation and mindfulness\nJournal\n\n\n\nManage:\n\nIs worrying actually helpful? If so, do it.\n\nWill this matter in 10 minutes? 10 weeks? 10 years?\n\n25% of the people you meet won’t like you, and you won’t like 25% of the people you meet. They may not be the same people. Similarly, imagine you’re an orange, and some people don’t like oranges. It doesn’t mean the orange is flawed in any way, just means that it’s not everyone’s preference.\n\nSimilarly, “Some people are like cacti, strong and hardy. Others are like daffodils, bright and can bend in the wind. And some are like orchids. Delicate and need to be looked after but are beautiful and awe inspiring. What matters most is the environment they are grown in.”\n\nYou’re not special; people are too worried about themselves to be thinking of you. Besides, it’s not your business what other people think of you\n\nPeople are gossiping about you? Let them. Your boyfriend wants to break up? Let them. Your friend doesn’t heed your advice that you think is best? Let them. People don’t agree with you? LET THEM.\nJust because you’ve always needed a reason to dislike someone, that’s why it hurts when someone dislikes you, but not everyone else has a reason\n\nAnxiety lives really well in the past and in the future. But has no place in the present. Bring yourself back to the present.\nExposure therapy to reduce anxious feelings; don’t avoid what you’re afraid of. Escape and avoidance only offer short-term relief and feed anxiety in the long run\nSlower, deeper breaths\nReframe cognitive distortions to be more realistic, threats as challenges to overcome, and treat anxiety as excitement\nSelf-compassion\nAct in line with your values\nSchedule worry time, and dump out all the thoughts in your brain during this time\nA lot of anxiety can trigger depression, so taking steps to manage anxiety first (taking time off, crying, etc) can reduce the depressive episodes\nBe mindful of “anxious fixing”, where you tackle small things on your to-do list as a way to avoid tackling the root cause of your anxiety."

    "text": "😭 Grief\nAs my grieving and recovery work progressed, I discovered why I was so intimacy-phobic: becoming intimate with another would (and eventually did) unlock the prodigious hunger of all my unmet needs for love. I was unconsciously terrified that if anyone began to meet those needs, I would begin to depend on them and end up needing them.\nGrief is love with nowhere to go. The depth of your grief is the depth of your love. Combines painful feelings of loss with a desire to get back what we lost, even if that’s impossible. Often triggered by endings of life, relationships, jobs. It’s a normal and natural part of being human, and the pain can be both physical and emotional. Trying to block out or repress grief can cause further problems down the line.\n5 stages of grief:\n\nDenial can help us survive the overwhelming pain of grief. As denial fades, this allows new waves of emotion to surface.\nWhen we experience anger about something we can’t control, using physical movement helps us to use the physiological arousal and bring the body back down to calm for a while.\nRuminating over the What ifs can easily lead down a path of self-blame.\nDepression is a normal reaction after a bereavement.\nAcceptance is not the same as liking or agreeing with the situation.\n\nManaging:\n\nLet the dead be dead - Give 30 minutes each day to experience and feel the grief at 100%, and then give yourself permission to be with the living\nThe Spirit Never Dies - Talk to the loved one who has passed; say what you’re grateful for and ask what they wish for you\nPractice mourning the loss by working through the pain, accepting the new reality, and not putting an expectation on how the process should go or how quickly you should be “done” with the process\nIf grieving a loss in childhood:\n\nFeelings of unfairness and resentment can arise, especially if the loss is great and requires many instances of grieving (can feel unending)\nPractice these components:\n\nAngering (Active)\nVerbal ventilation (Active) - speaking or writing to release painful feelings in uncensored way\nCrying (Active) - can bring catastrophizing to a halt\nFeeling emotions throughout body in present moment, not resisting (Passive)\n\n\nIf grieving climate change:\n\nAccept the Severity of the Predicament\nBe with Uncertainty\nHonor My Mortality and the Mortality of All\nDo Inner Work\nDevelop Awareness of Biases and Perception\nPractice Gratitude, Seek Beauty, and Create Connections\nTake Breaks and Rest\nGrieve the Harm I Have Caused\nShow Up\nReinvest in Meaningful Efforts\n\nBe mindful of ambiguous grief, where murky losses are confronted (single people longing for a relationship, partner lost to Alzheimer’s, woman unable to become pregnant, etc) and are generally unacknowledged by society at large"

    "text": "⚙️ Emotional Regulation\nEmotions give us data about ourselves and other people; us expressing our emotions also displays that data to other people. Generally, emotions signal something that we need to ourselves or others.\nThere are no “bad” or “good” emotions, despite how society may label them. While emotions are not always fact, pushing the emotion away can cause more problems than letting it run its course. In a mentally healthy state, emotions can validate and reward us for practicing healthy behaviors that help us thrive.\nTypes of Regulation:\n\nAuto-Regulation (it just happens automatically)\n\nThumb-sucking\naverting eye contact\nReading\ndoing art\nwatching TV\nAlcohol & drugs\nMasturbating\nDaydreaming\nOvereating\nSwiping or scrolling on your phone\n\nExternal Regulation (You do it)\n\nBeing held and soothed by a caregiver\n\nTalking with a friend about your problems\nListening to a live talk or music\nGetting a massage\n\n\nInteractive Regulation (We do it)\n\nDancing with a partner\n\nSex\nHaving a mutual dialogue\nMusicians playing together\n\nCooking together\n\nSelf-Regulation (I do it)\n\nBreath control\n\nMental techniques like cognitive reframing\nMuscle relaxation\n\nVocal control\n\n\nNervous system responses:\n\nSafe (parasympathetic & ventral vagal)\nFight (sympathetic)\nFlight (sympathetic)\nFreeze (parasympathetic & dorsal vagal)\n\nShutdown/Collapse (extreme hypoarousal)\n\nFawn (blended sympathetic and parasympathetic)\n\nAttach\nSubmit\n\n\nHow to regulate:\n\nRemember you are not your feelings and your feelings are not who you are. You can’t control your emotions, but you can control what you do with them\nIdeally teakettle emotions - let emotions out somehow before hitting a breaking point\nBeware intellectualizing your feelings\n\nYou’ve used humor your whole life to compartmentalize your trauma and keep it at arm’s length. This is the first moment where you acknowledge that it’s real, and it happened, and it’s a part of who you are.\n\nAcknowledge and name emotion; use emotions wheel if necessary\nPause and notice physical sensations - don’t avoid emotion or use distractions\nSit in silence for a few minutes\nDon’t rationalize or justify your feeling, you can ask “What story are you telling yourself about this emotion, and is it true?”\nAccept feeling may come up again but will be less intense each consecutive time"

Some of them look attractive and some do not. We do not have to pick every single one up and eat it. The acceptance part in ACT is to learn to let the less nourishing dishes float past us without engaging.\n\nExpansion\n\nMake room for unpleasant feelings and sensations instead of trying to suppress them or push them away\n\nNotice Yourself Noticing Situations (The Observing Self)\n\nie, you are not your thoughts\n\nConnect with the Present Moment\nClarify your Values\nMake Values-Driven Decisions\n\nStrategies:\n\nI’m Having the Thought That - awareness between having the thought and getting caught up in the narrative\nMusical Thinking - sing-song in head for negative thoughts\nNaming Stories - label stories when your brain begins to tell them; benefits are like labeling emotions\nThank Mind - when brain continues to retell/rehash narratives\nSilly Voices Technique - Hear thoughts in a silly character’s voice, like a cartoon character\nTV Screen - imagine thoughts are like a TV show. Make it a specific genre, with specific music and acting, to help detach self from thought.\n\nDistort image by flipping upside down, spinning it around, stretch image beyond bounds of screen, make black and white, etc.\nIf thoughts are more like a movie clip, play in slow motion, play backwards, play forward in double speed\nApply silly subtitles or voiceovers to the movie\nAdd a ridiculous musical soundtrack\nShift the location and the genre\n\nDemons on the Boat - imagine demons are around you and allowed to be around all the ship. Don’t try and keep them below deck in repression.\nClouds in the sky – see your mind as a sky and thoughts are just clouds passing you by.\nRiver stream – Everything is in a constant state of flux – and your thoughts, feelings, and experiences flow through consciousness in the same way water flows through a stream. Your mind is the river and your thoughts are just things flowing down it. Give it time and it will pass.\nSuggestion box – Your mind is genuinely trying to help and serve your best interests, but it doesn’t always suggest the best ideas, and you have the power to veto any thought you have\nFeeding the wolves - if one wolf represents light and hope and the other represents darkness and despair, the wolf you feed will win\nBurning your thoughts – One fun exercise for overcoming negative thoughts and stripping them of their power is to burn away negative thoughts. Just get a piece of paper and a pen, then write down 5-7 negative thoughts that have been occupying your mind lately. Then get a lighter and find a safe place to burn the piece of paper\nPassengers on a bus - you visualize yourself as a bus driver, and every thought you have is a passenger that gets on (and off) the bus.\nBrain Drain - Give yourself 5-10 minutes to write whatever comes to your mind, without any self-filtering or self-editing. This completely “stream of consciousness” writing can often help to purge thoughts that have been hanging around in your head (even ones that you may not be aware of).\n\n\n\n🧠 Brainspotting\nIn a nutshell, through some quirk of the brain, stuck trauma can actually be accessed through the visual cortex. Brainspotting takes advantage of this to help process trauma. By identifying eye positions correlating with emotional activation, healing and release through the mind-body connection can occur.\n\n\n🔎 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\nFocuses on modifying dysfunctional emotions, behaviors, and thoughts by interrogating and uprooting negative or irrational beliefs.\nCommon negative beliefs (also known as core wounds):\n\nI am worthless / unworthy\nI deserve pain / suffering / misery / punishment / disrespect\nI am stupid\nI am weak / helpless / unsafe / powerless / stuck\nI am inadequate / not good enough / not doing enough\nI am a failure\nI am broken / defective\nI am a bad person\nI can’t trust others\nI am unwanted / unlovable / disliked / don’t belong\nI don’t deserve to be happy\nI am abandoned / alone / disconnected / excluded / rejeected\nI am weak and helpless\nI am unseen and unheard\nI don’t matter and am unimportant\nMy life will always be like this, nothing will ever help, my life sucks, I’ll never get better\nEveryone has moved on without me\nI am a burden\n\nSigns these beliefs negatively impact you:\n\nEntering relationships in the hopes of finding what you lack inside in the other person\nFeeling inadequate\nFeel a sense of abandonment, resentment, or betrayal from others regularly\nA perfectionistic attitude towards life (i.e., you gain your self-esteem from the outcome of your actions instead of the intention behind your actions)\nHave chronic anxiety that comes as a result of anticipating the emotional pain of being found unworthy, which deep down you think is true\nRepeating the same old mistakes in relationships because you’re stuck in negative unconscious programming, and you don’t feel courageous enough to make a change.\nFinding happiness in your misery because it’s a source of attention in the form of sympathy from other people.\nHaving a large, unexplored Shadow Self.\nBehaving in dishonest and inauthentic ways that are not true to the person you really are to gain the acceptance of others.\nEmotional numbness, a sense of meaninglessness and disconnection from the world around you. In a sense, this is the ultimate defense mechanism: to feel nothing.\nStrong inner critic\nFeeling like an outcast, and you can never quite fit in with anyone. Instead of appreciating your uniqueness and seeing it as an opportunity, you see it as a curse.\n\nWays to change beliefs:\n\nUnderstand all your beliefs. Which support growth and which don’t?\n\nNotice unhealthy patterns in your life and recurrent challenges. Could a limiting belief be the root cause?\nWhen a negative belief shows up, ask “according to whom?” to narrow down where the standard originally came from\n\nCatch thoughts when they occur\nQuestion the thought when it comes in. Is it true, harmful, or exaggerated?\nChange it - use evidence gathered to replace the belief with a more compassionate message\n5 Whys - write down what your problem is, ask “why?” 5 times to get to the root of the issue, and find reasonable solution to what you find\nBeware Approval Addiction - your worth cannot be determined by whether other approve of you or not; needs to come from within. Remember rejection is not your fault, rewrite your silent assumptions about yourself and the world, use cost-benefit analysis on if it’s worth maintaining current behavior, and develop a blueprint of self-respect\nPractice emotional accounting - recognize negative thoughts, what emotions are associated, what cognitive distortion they fall under, give a rational response to the toxic thought (self-defense), and develop realistic self-evaluation system to tackle the system\n\nPositive beliefs to develop instead:\n\nI want to develop a more consistently loving and accepting relationship with myself. I want an increasing capacity for self-acceptance.\nI want to become the best possible friend to myself.\nI want my relationships to be based on love, respect, fairness, and mutual support.\nI want to expand into full, uninhibited self-expression.\nI want to attain the best possible physical health.\nI want to cultivate a balance of exuberance and peace.\nI want to attract to myself loving friends and loving community.\nI want increasing freedom from toxic shame.\nI want increasing freedom from unnecessary fear.\nI want rewarding and fulfilling work.\nI want a healthy amount of peace of mind, spirit, soul, and body.\nI want to increase my capacity to play and have fun.\nI want to make plenty of room for beauty and nature in my life.\nI want sufficient physical and monetary resources.\nI want a fair amount of help (self, human, or divine) to get what I need.\nI want divine love, grace, and blessing.\nI want a balance of work, play, and rest.\nI want a balance of stability and change.\nI want a balance of loving interaction and healthy self-sufficiency.\nI want full emotional expression with a balance of laughter and tears.\nI want sexual satisfaction.\nI want to express my anger in effective and nonabusive ways.\nI want all this for each and every other human being as well as myself.\n\n\n\nDialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)\nMeant for people who struggle with undercontrol and people with anxious attachment styles. A bit over-obsessed with acronyms, but there are 4 main components to treatment:\n\nDistress Tolerance\nMindfulness\nInterpersonal Effectiveness\nEmotional Regulation\n\nDBT Legitimate Rights:\n1. You have a right to need things from others\n2. You have a right to put yourself first sometimes\n3. You have a right to feel and express your emotions and pain\n4. You have a right to be the final judge of your beliefs and accept them as legitimate\n5. You have a right to your opinions and convictions\n6. You have a right to your experience, even if it's different from other people\n7. You have a right to protest any treatment or criticism that feels bad to you\n8. You have a right to negotiate for change\n9. You have a right to ask for help, emotional support, or anything else you may need (though you may not always get it)\n10. You have a right to say no; it doesn't make you bad or selfish\n11. You have a right not to justify yourself to others\n12. You have a right to choose not to respond to a situation\nYou have a right to occasionally disappoint or inconvenience others\nDBT suggests using distraction in times of distress\n\nRadical Acceptance\nDistraction, Self Destructive (fling hairtie into wrist, etc)\nDistraction, Pleasurable Activity (walk, journal, etc)\nDistraction, Focus on someone else (help a friend with something)\nDistract with thoughts (recall happier times)\nDistract and leave situation\nDistract with tasks and chores\nDistract by counting (breathing, brain teasers, etc)\n\nDialectical behavioral therapists often distinguish between willfulness (trying to fight reality, common with systemic shame) and willingness (acknowledging and working with reality on its own terms).\nWillfulness includes bitterness, obsession, rumination, frustration, feeling “stuck”, why a situation “should not be”, sticking rigidly to a plan, and thinking a great deal about the past. Identify willfulness with the following questions:\n\nWhat are some unspoken “rules” that I still let guide my life?\nWhich of these rules no longer serve me?\nWhat can I do less of?\nWhat facts of my life am I still trying to make not be true?\nWhat can I give up on for now?\nWhat unpleasant truths can I decide to just live with?\nWhat can I stop trying to make work?\n\nWillingness includes lightness, acceptance, adaptation, mourning, feeling relaxed, asking “what’s next?”, improvising based on current information, and paying attention to the present.\n\n\n👁️ EMDR\nThere is a difference between knowing and understanding. I had known that this wasn’t my fault. EMDR unlocked the gate to the next realm, toward understanding. The difference is one between rote memorization and true learning. Between hypothesis and belief. Between prayer and faith. It seems obvious now—how can there be love without faith?\n\nFloatback Technique - Bring to mind a negative cognition and recent event. Where do you feel it in your body? As you think of the recent incident and the negative cognition, notice the feelings in your body, and let your mind float back to childhood. What memory comes to mind when you felt that way? If something automatically comes to mind, then write it down in your Memory column along with your age and the SUD level. Using cue words, list the earliest memories and the ones with the highest SUD level.\nButterfly Hug - Cross your arms in front of you with your right hand on your left shoulder and your left hand on your right. Then you tap your hands alternately on each shoulder slowly four to six times. To try it, bring up the image of the safe or calm place along with that positive word that you’ve connected with it and allow yourself to go into that state of safety or calm. And when you have that sense, tap alternately on your thighs or with the Butterfly Hug four to six times, then stop and take a breath and see how it feels.\n\n\n\n☠️ Existential Therapy\nWhen it comes to finding (or creating) meaning in life, existential therapists look to what they call the four realms of human experience:\n\nThe physical realm, which guides how we view our physical surroundings, our bodies, and how we think about our own deaths.\n\nHow can I live my life fully, knowing I may die at any moment?\nWhat helps you feel real, in touch with your body and surroundings?\n\nEx: Learning, hands-on skills, self-care\n\n\nThe social realm, which guides how we think and feel about other people, as well as the culture(s) to which we belong.\n\nWhat are other people there for?\nWhat helps you feel recognized and appreciated as you really are?\n\nEx: Shared passions, challenges, vulnerability.\n\n\nThe personal realm, which guides our understanding of ourselves, including the life stories we tell about our past experiences, our present situation, and what we hope for our futures.\n\nHow can I be me?\nWhich ways of spending time do I never regret?\n\nEx: Hobbies, creative endeavors, childlike wonder, etc.\n\n\nThe spiritual realm, which guides how we feel about the unknown and uncertain, as well as our core values and how we think the world ought to be.\n\nHow should I live?\nWhat helps me see that I am a part of something larger than myself?\n\nEx: Mentorship, creative work, volunteering\n\n\n\n\n\n👶 Inner Child Work\n“No parent does a perfect job, so no parent does a complete job. Every adult needs to finish the job of parenting themselves.”\nGenerally done through reparenting yourself. A common method is the Ideal Parent Figure Protocol, where you release negative introjects (parental figures and values) you internalized as a child.\n\nRecognize you are separate from your parents, and can live life according to your values, not theirs\nForgive your parents. Doesn’t mean condoning their actions or forgetting, but letting go of anger and resentment towards them.\nBuild a relationship with yourself (learning who you are, what you want out of life, accepting and loving yourself despite flaws)\nDevelop a new internal parent to provide love and guidance you need (based on either real or fictional character)\n\nPillars of reparenting:\n\nEmotional regulation\nLoving discipline - setting boundaries, saying no, stating needs, following routines\nSelf-care - healthy diet, sleep, meditation, journaling, nature, etc\nChild-like wonder - creativity + imagination; joy + spontaneity + playfulness.\n\nPlay more often; the opposite of play is depression (childhood movies, TV shows, video games, books, hobbies, treating yourself)\n\n\nExercises:\n\nReparenting journal exercise\n\nHow does you show up in the world as a child? Who were you at your best? How did you interact with others and the world around you? Write down 5-20 traits describing how you were as a child.\nHow do you show up in the world today? Who are you at your best? How do you interact with others and the world around you? Write down 5-20 traits describing your ideal inner adult.\nAllow these two parts to have a conversation with each other to better understand one another. Let the inner child take the lead on the conversation and make sure they’re heard first and foremost\n\n\n\nSelf-Mothering\nHeals the wounds of self-neglect.\n\nI want you.\nI love you.\nI’ll take care of you.\nYou can trust me.\nI’ll be there for you; I’ll be there even when you die.\nIt is not what you do but who you are that I love.\nYou are special to me.\nI love you, and I give you permission to be different from me.\nSometimes I will tell you “no” and that’s because I love you.\nMy love will make you well.\nI see you and I hear you.\nYou can trust your inner voice. You don’t have to be afraid anymore.\n\n\n\nSelf-Fathering\nHeals the wounds of abuse. Self-fathering gestates assertiveness and self-protection. It includes confronting external or internal abuse, and standing up for the adult child’s rights.\n\nI love you.\nI have confidence in you. I am sure you can do it.\nI will set limits and I will enforce them. (“You do have to go to school.”)\nIf you fall down, I will pick you up. (Learning to ride a bicycle is a common example of this experience with father.”\nYou are special to me. I am proud of you.\n(Especially for women) You are beautiful, and I give you permission to be a sexual being.\n(Especially for men) I give you permission to be the same as I am AND permission to be more than I am AND permission to be less than I am.\n\n\n\n\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Internal Family Systems (IFS)\nIFS believes that a person’s personality is made up of various parts:\n\nCore Self / Wise Adult\n\nPurpose: Creative, Curious, Compassionate, Confident. In more polarized systems, parts generally don’t trust the Core Self’s leadership and wisdom\nGoal: differentiate the core self from other blended parts, improve self-leadership across your parts, improve inner harmony and reduce polarization between parts\n\nExiles\n\nPurpose: Hold disowned and painful feelings and traumatic memories. They are most commonly child and teenaged parts.\nGoal: be acknowledged, unburdened, reassured, and nurtured by the self. Stop hijacking the system in times of distress.\n\nManagers\n\nPurpose: Suppress and contain exiled parts, Protect the system and focus on daily living tasks\nGoal: Let go of extreme roles, adapt role to present day needs, and work under Core Self leadership, be more trusting of Core Self\n\nFirefighters\n\nPurpose: Use extreme measures to distract, dissociate, and numb the system when the Exiles are triggered\nGoal: No longer needed to perform their extreme roles\n\n\nGoals of IFS:\n\nLiberate parts from the roles they’ve been forced into, so they can be who they’re designed to be.\nRestore trust in the Self and Self-leadership.\nReharmonize the inner system.\nBecome more Self-led in your interactions with the world.\n\n\n\n📔 Narrative Therapy\nPeople are made up of many narratives. Narrative therapy begins with investigating your narrative and bringing it to your awareness.\n\nExternalizing\n\nViewing a problem as separate from yourself\n\nDeconstructing\n\nBe curious and investigative as you break the story down into smaller parts\n\nReauthoring\n\nTaking what you learned from deconstructing and putting back together to understand the stories in a different way\n\nRemembering\n\nExplore the impact of figures in your life - link people with values, commitments, and preferences that contribute to a positive narrative\n\n\n\n\n🤕 Pain Reprocessing Therapy\n“It’s so hard to make people feel anything other than pain.” - the consequence of people interacting with each other relative to AI systems.\nA modality for treating chronic pain that is driven by the mind-body connection. This modality purports that the causes of chronic pain are tied to childhood trauma and major life events (serious illness or injury, death of a loved one, loss of a relationship, etc), and neural pathways become wired to encourage further pain, leading to a self-perpetuating cycle.\nPain comes from the brain and nervous system; it is not a purely physical experience, and thus can be changed. It is designed to protect you, and part of the recovery process is learning just what it’s trying to protect you from.\nPersonality traits associated with chronic pain include:\n\nHypersensitivity (can be more of a physiological trait)\nPerfectionism\nStrong Inner Critic\nPeople-Pleasing\nNegative Thinking and Pessimism\n\nTackle with Cognitive Behavioral Techniques\n\nLack of Joy and Play\nLack of Self-Compassion and Gratitude\nDifficulty Setting Boundaries with Others\nPain Catastrophizing\n\nDo you magnify pain in mind?\nDo you ruminate about pain?\nDo you feel helpless; convinced it’ll never get better?\n\n\nSigns of not coping well:\n\nRegular doctor and healthcare visits\nClinging to ambiguous diagnoses as your identity\nSpending more time on bed or couch\nStaying in pajamas all day\nDropping old hobbies without warning; fewer hobbies or pleasurable activities in general (less socializing, exercise, etc)\nMissing work and sleeping during the day\nNeeding pain medication\nFewer chores done\nSelf-soothing with food\n\nSigns of heightened health anxiety (related due the symptom imperative, though validate with a doctor if symptom is new):\n\nMuscle twitching all over body\nNumbness\nBlurry vision\nDizziness\nYellow shits\nStomachaches, spasming stomach, bloating, acid reflux\nWhite covered tongue\nBrain fog, inability to concentrate\nheart jumps and scares\nBloodshot eyes\nchest tightness and pain\nheadaches\nmigraines with aura\near ache\nringing in my ear\ncrawling sensation in my ear\nulcers like all the time\nfelt weak (e.g. In the gym)\nNausea\nBack pain\nJoint pain\njittery jaw/ involuntary jaw moving\nswollen lymph nodes\nnumbness and tingling down one side of face\n\nRecovery from chronic pain is not a linear process; relapses will happen and that is NORMAL! Steps to recovery are as follows:\n\nUnderstand Pain Triggers\n\nEmotions: Anger, Sadness, Shame, Loneliness, Fear, Numbness, etc\nSituations: Conflict, job loss, missing out on activities due to illness, etc\nBiological: Poor sleep, poor diet, dehydration, bright lights and loud noises, lack of exercise, etc\nMental: Negative self-talk, pressure to fix yourself and/or be perfect,\n\nUnderstand Conditioned Responses\n\nBrains can make unfortunate connections and associations, even if they aren’t true or helpful, in an attempt to keep you safe\nNot pain specific; can be “standing in a crowd causes a panic attack” or “standing causes pain”\n\nReinforce Evidence of Pain Being Neuroplastic / Triggered by Fear\n\nPain moves around entire body\nBecomes more intense (or disappears) when emotions run high\nSearch for general exceptions to rule you have noticed in the past\nIf feeling really stuck, imagine a miracle - what would your life be like if the pain all disappeared tomorrow? What would you do?\nAllow for hope for the future by saying “yet” at the end of negative thoughts\nIn general, give the pain voice less airtime and/or don’t take it as seriously\n\nSomatic Tracking\n\nMindfulness of sensations within the body with no agenda or judgment\n\nWhat do you notice happening to the sensation as you focus on it? Does it intensify or subside? Does it spread out or contract? Does it move around or stay exactly the same? Does the quality of the sensation change at all?\nIf that doesn’t work: Visualize the pain as toxic black ooze and envision it leaving the body\n\nCognitive Soothing - Send messages of safety to the brain\n\n“It’s going to be okay either way” is a type of safety reappraisal that can be really effective in the face of uncertainty\nWhen fear thoughts arise notice them, don’t buy into them, and send a message of safety anyways\n\nPositive Affect Induction - approach sensations with lightness and curiosity; turn down the intensity and watching it like a hawk\nOutcome Independence - feeling successful regardless of the result (do not do somatic tracking with the goal of eradicating your pain)\n\nDevelop Corrective Experiences\n\nFeeling safe during exposure to the source of your fear; requires repeated events to rewire your brain to accept that an experience/emotion/sensation/etc is safe\nBeware Extinction Bursts - where symptoms intensify as the brain makes a last-ditch effort to maintain the current behavior. Ride the wave and do not give into the fear\n\nMinimize Use of Avoidance Behaviors\n\nBeware Vampire Mode - what we do affects how we think and feel. Withdrawing from pleasant experiences (leaving the house, seeing friends, working, hobbies, exercising, sunlight and fresh air, etc) will cause a crash in mood and make you feel worse as you feel more excluded socially and professionally\n\nReduce Hypervigilance and Allow for Pleasant Sensations\nUnderstand Relapses\n\nStages are Panic, Forcing It (doing the same recovery steps with desperation), Stabilization (doing recovery steps with the right intentions)\nDigging into weeds on childhood trauma and constantly revisiting isn’t always the answer to reducing pain\n\nDon’t Google your symptoms lest you think you have a stroke, tumor, heart attack, cancer, lyme disease, etc\n\n\n\nRadically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO DBT)\nWe don’t feel connected because we feel safe. We feel safe because we feel connected.\nRadically Open DBT is meant for disorders of overcontrol (OC) and people with avoidant attachment styles. The core problem with OC clients include social signaling deficits, low openness, and aloofness. OC is a combination of nature, nurture, and risk-averse coping mechanisms Difference between DBT vs RO DBT\nOverall, clients need to let go of always striving to perform better or try harder.\nSigns of OC:\n\nInhibited and disingenuous emotional expression\n\nFear of expressing a different opinion\nHiding how you’re feeling\n\nSaying you’re fine when you’re not\nNever wanting others to know when you’re upset, in distress\nAvoiding and deflecting answering questions\n\n\nHyper detailed, focused, and overly cautious behavior\nRigid and rule-governed behavior\n\nConstantly seeing mistakes everywhere, especially yourself\nForeboding joy - always expecting the other shoe to drop\nNeed to plan and prepare for everything\nCompulsive fixers\n\nAloof and distant style of relating\n\nAvoiding eye contact\nKeeping self physically small, closed off body language\nLeaving when uncomfortable, especially during conflicts\nPride in extreme self-control abilities\nOnly laughing/smiling when a joke is truly funny\nDelay or avoid returning calls and texts\n\nHigh social comparison, envy, and bitterness\n\nSkills:\n\nSelf-enquiry\n\nMindfulness practice that patients can use to better understand themselves and why they interact with the world in the way they do\n“What is it that I might need to learn from the experience?”\nKeep self-enquiry practices &lt;5 mins and don’t always trust the quick answers/urges you receive\n\nUse social signaling to attract others and feel safe by activating your social safety system\nPractice urge surfing when unwanted impulses occur\nPractice compassion when in a fixed and fatalistic mindset; aim to adapt a flexible mindset\nCultivate healthy self-doubt\n\nWe don’t see things as they are but rather as we are.\n\nBig 3 + 1 Exercise\n\nTake a deep breath by slowly inhaling and exhaling, and simultaneously:\nEngage in a closed-mouth smile (turn up the ends of your lips and stretch your lips over your teeth). Note that this type of smile activates the muscles around your eyes (where you typically see wrinkles). If you try this smile and only the bottom half of your face is moving, you may be practising what’s referred to as a half-smile. Ensure that you activate the muscles around your eyes.\nRaise your eyebrows for a moment.\nAdditionally, if you are sitting in a chair with a back, then lean back.\n\n\n\n\nSchema Therapy\nList of Maladaptive Schemas\n\nAbandonment & Instability\n\nTreatment: Mindfulness of company you keep, tendency to catastrophize, practice meditation\n\nMistrust & Abuse\n\nTreatment: Strengthen connection with present, mindful of company you keep, take steps to trust others\n\nEmotional Deprivation\n\nSigns: Emotionally feeling flat, disliking emotions, avoiding emotional situations, being “robotic” or otherwise detached, hiding emotions, only feeling emotion in nonpersonal ways\nTreatment: Consider your past, use a third-person narrative to describe your feelings, read fiction, pay attention to fictional character’s needs and feelings, use feelings wheel, learn about boundaries, practice sharing emotions with people who care, attending to emotions with care, validation, nurturing, and security\n\nDefectiveness & Shame\nSocial Isolation & Alienation\n\nSigns: Find social activities exhausting, hiding who you really are, believe if people see the real you they’ll reject you, compare self unfavorably to others, strong inner critic, and often feel lonely\nTreatment: Review the past, change your POV, take stock, take a sober look at the situation, take action against the inner critic, start repairing your self-esteem\n\nDependence & Incompetence\nVulnerability to Harm or Illness\nEnmeshment & Undeveloped Self\nFailure to Achieve\nEntitlement & Grandiosity\nInsufficient Self-Control & Self-Discipline\nSubjugation\n\nSigns: Avoidance of triggers, overcompensation of behavior, surrendering to other people’s needs and emotions\nStrategies: Learn about yourself and likes/preferences, learn to be assertive, learn to tolerate uncomfortable feelings, reframe how you think about yourself, seek therapy to deal with anger, disappointment, and sadness\n\nSelf-Sacrifice\nApproval & Recognition Seeking\nNegativity & Pessimism\nEmotional Inhibition\nUnrelenting Standards & Hypercriticalness\nPunitiveness\n\nPeople, including oneself, should be harshly punished for making mistakes\n\n\nMaladaptive Coping Responses\n\nOvercompensation\n\nAggression & Hostility\nDominance\nRecognition Seeking\nManipulation & Exploitation\nPassive-Aggressiveness & Rebellion\nExcessive Orderliness & Obsessionality\n\nSurrender\n\nCompliance & Dependence\n\nAvoidance\n\nSocial Withdrawal & Excessive Autonomy\nCompulsive Stimulation Seeking\nAddictive Self-Soothing\nPsychological Withdrawal\n\n\nSchema Modes:\n\nInnate child modes\n\nVulnerable child\nAngry child\nImpulsive child\nContented child\n\nMaladaptive coping modes\n\nCompliant surrenderer\nDetached protector\nOvercompensator\n\nMaladaptive parent modes\n\nPunitive parent\nDemanding parent\n\nHealthy adult mode"

They require comparison with others.\nEulogy virtues - the aspects of character that others praise when a person isn’t around to hear it: humility, kindness, bravery.

    "text": "✈️ Escapism\nTo cope with unstable times, Soviet citizens enduring the daily stresses of a failing state turned inward. They called it “internal emigration,” a metaphor for the imagined inner world to which ordinary people could retreat to find solace. This mental relocation took many forms, but for most Soviets, cultivating a fierce spiritual autonomy—through music, literature, poetry, art, foreign language learning, private gardening, or immersing themselves in nature—provided the only respite from the grinding indignities of an aging political bureaucracy insensitive to the needs of the populace.\nBut internal emigration can cultivate the habit of apathy. The very real desire to protect oneself from the pressures of an unjust system promotes disengagement and undermines our cognitive capacities for hope. More importantly, when the system unexpectedly changes, we may be unprepared to fight for a new world."

    "text": "💼 Workaholism\nWhether it’s your career, community projects, or personal to-do lists that consume your everyday life, your addiction to activity is problematic for many reasons. Once you get a dose of completing a job, an impulsive urge to drown yourself in more activity immediately creeps in. Without it, you experience a profound sense of worthlessness.\nThis kind of “improvement” workaholism is about self-worth and a felt sense of safety. Because idleness feels unsafe in the body of a workaholic, non-activity is misconstrued as uselessness, which feels like a gaping hole in your beingness. The wisdom of a workaholic’s body knows that not creating, producing, or improving oneself or the environment is on par with being an unlovable sack of garbage. So your body keeps you busy.\nA work-oriented perfectionist unconsciously harbors a belief that they’re unworthy unless they’re busy fixing themselves or the world. Learn to be in touch with what you’re feeling in your body, known as interoception. This alone is a practice that will pay you back tenfold in overall well-being, decision-making, and trusting your inner guidance."

In ACT this is called “dirty pain”: we don’t just experience anger or sadness, but we add to it an additional layer of suffering.\n\n\n\n\n🪷 Buddhism\n\nCarpet Shoes Analogy - If you want to walk on a carpet all day, it’s harder to cover the world in carpet than it is to wear carpet shoes. (ie, reduce needs you have to fulfill to increase likelihood they get met)\nKintsugi - bowls that shattered, but are repaired by golden glue to be made whole again. (ie, don’t assume because something is broken that it’s useless)\nOubaitori - imagine there are four different flowers: cherry, apricot, peach, and plum. Which one is “better” and which one is “falling behind”? (ie, comparisons with others are pointless because each flower has its own journey, focus on your individual growth journey)\nUkeireru - accepting the realities that surround you, too – your relationships, your roles in the communities you’re a part of, and the situations you face – rather than fighting them\nVasana - Imagine your mind is like a big library, and every book in it is a memory or experience you’ve had. Now, Vasana is like a bookmark that keeps track of certain books you’ve read a lot. These books are your habits or tendencies. Just like you might automatically reach for your favorite snack without thinking, Vasana is the automatic way you might react to things because you’ve done it that way before. It’s like a mental shortcut your brain takes based on past experiences.\n\nOther Reflections:\n\nYou cannot practice non-attachment. You can only show your mind the suffering that attachment creates. When it sees this clearly, it will let go.\nFinding your true self is an act of love. Expressing it is an act of rebellion.\nA sign of growth is having more tolerance for discomfort. But it’s also having less tolerance for bullshit.\nWho you are is not your fault, but it is your responsibility.\nProcrastination is the refusal or inability to be with difficult emotions.\nDesires that arise in agitation are more aligned with your ego. Desires that arise in stillness are more aligned with your soul.\nThe moment before letting go is often when we grip the hardest.\nYou don’t find your ground by looking for stability. You find your ground by relaxing into instability.\nWhat you hate most in others is usually what you hate most in yourself.\nThe biggest life hack is to become your own best friend. Everything is easier when you do.\nThe more comfortable you become in your own skin, the less you need to manufacture the world around you for comfort.\nAn interesting thing happens when you start to like yourself. You no longer need all the things you thought you needed to be happy.\nIf you don’t train your mind to appreciate what is good, you’ll continue to look for something better in the future, even when things are great.\nThe belief that there is some future moment more worth our presence than the one we’re in right now is why we miss our lives.\nThere is no set of conditions that leads to lasting happiness. Lasting happiness doesn’t come from conditions; it comes from learning to flow with conditions.\nSpend more time cultivating a mind that is not attached to material things than time spent accumulating them.\nSometimes we need to get out of alignment with the rest of the world to get back into alignment with ourselves.\nReal confidence looks like humility. You no longer need to advertise your value because it comes from a place that does not require the validation of others.\nHigh pain tolerance is a double-edged sword. It’s key for self-control, but can cause us to override the pain of being out of alignment.\nNegative thoughts will not manifest a negative life. But unconscious negative thoughts will.\nTo feel more joy, open to your pain.\nBullying yourself into enlightenment does not work. Befriending yourself is how you transcend yourself.\nPeak experiences are fun, but you always have to come back. Learning to appreciate ordinary moments is the key to a fulfilling life.\nMeditation is not about feeling good. It’s about feeling what you’re feeling with good awareness. Plot twist: Eventually that makes you feel good.\nIf you are able to watch your mind think, it means who you are is bigger than your thoughts.\nPracticing stillness is not about privileging stillness over movement. It’s about the CAPACITY to be still amidst your impulses. It’s about choice.\nThe issue is not that we get distracted. It’s that we’re so distracted by distractions we don’t even know we’re distracted.\nThere are 3 layers to a moment: Your experience, your awareness of the experience, and your story about the experience. Be mindful of the story.\nLife is always happening in just one moment. That’s all you’re responsible for.\nYour mind doesn’t wander. It moves toward what it finds most interesting. If you want to focus better, become more curious about what’s in front of you.\nLife continues whether you’re paying attention to it or not. I think that is why the passage of time is scary.\nMeditation can quickly become spiritualized suppression. Be careful not to use concentration to avoid what is uncomfortable.\nOne of the deepest forms of peace we can experience is living in integrity. You can lie to other people about who you are, but you can’t lie to your heart.\nBe careful not to let the noise of your mind overpower the whispers of your heart.\nMonks love to fart while they meditate. The wisdom of letting go expresses itself in many forms.\nYou can’t life-hack wisdom. Do the work."

    "text": "🦺 Safety Behaviors\nTo have any hope of experiencing a deeper, lasting shift, we must recognise that as much as we want change, a part of us is terrified of it, and will fight against it, because we also want things to stay the same. Part of us is choosing a safer life over a better life.\nSafety behaviors are things that we do to with the intention of keeping us safe. They can include forms of avoidance, distraction, preparing, and checking. While safety behaviors may offer immediate relief from anxiety, they actually trap you in a long-term cycle of fear.\nSigns of safety behaviors:\n\nSitting only in the back row of the classroom to avoid being noticed.\nAvoiding eye contact while grocery shopping and while going through the check-out.\nWearing sunglasses while using public transportation (even on gloomy days).\nOver-preparing for presentations or meetings.\nMentally rehearsing conversations before they happen.\nCarrying a bottle of anti-anxiety medication whenever outside of the home.\nLeaving the house only if accompanied by a trusted loved one.\nCreating an escape plan from any building entered.\nChecking the locks on the house or car door multiple times.\nFrequently checking or going on electronics during social interactions.\nConsuming alcohol, recreational drugs, or other substances to curb anxiety.\nEngaging in superstitious rituals before, during, or after situation that elicits anxiety.\nAvoidance of locations or situations that tend to increase anxiety.\nHaving to carry a certain object in situations that tend to increase anxiety.\nFrequent visits to the doctor for slight changes in physical symptoms or sensations.\nFrequent checking of heart rate, blood pressure, or other vital recordings.\nStaying awake for long periods of time to ensure safety of home.\nWearing excessive amounts of clothing when in public to avoid attention.\nRe-reading a text or e-mail multiple times before sending.\nCalling a loved one several times throughout the day to check on their safety or well-being.\n\nCBT aims to break this cycle by replacing these behaviors with exposure therapy. Through facing anxiety-provoking situations without safety crutches, you teach your brain new ways to handle them, leading to reduced anxiety and a life aligned with your values. It’s like experiencing discomfort now for long-term peace, instead of the other way around."

It is a first order event that happens when you live your truth.\nHappiness is pleasure related to your surroundings or your current circumstances.\nThree main factors involved in happiness (generally obtained through relationships and careers):\n\nA sense of identity - a narrative of emotionally salient experiences\nGenerativity - build something in the world (volunteer, artistic pursuit, or DIY projects)\nReflecting on the life you’ve lived\n\nSigns:\n\nLack of suspicion and resentment\nNot living in the past\nNot wasting time and energy fighting things you cannot change\nStaying involved in the living world\nRefuse to indulge in self-pity\nCultivate old-fashioned virtues\nDon’t expect too much from yourself\nFind something bigger than yourself to believe in\n\nHow to think of happiness:\n\nPursuing happiness is fine, but concern about happiness leads to negative meta-emotions (feelings about feelings)\n\nExample: You set up a birthday party. You can aspire to be happy or overthink it (why am I not happy?), triggering further disappointment that compounds onto itself\nDon’t judge your emotions or intensely monitor your feelings (more likely to judge)\nDon’t treat life/activities as a means to an end - “Happiness is like a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but, if you sit down quietly, may alight upon you.”\n\nThink of happiness like a retirement portfolio. Balance it in terms of stocks/bonds/etc, short-term vs long-term, and more. Focusing entirely on purpose means forgoing joy and the small daily moments that make life enjoyable\nFinancial security (to a certain extent) can add happiness, as money is a big stressor in people’s lives\nHappiest people socialize 6-7 hours a day in person; for every new friend you add to your social network you’re 15% more likely to be happy"

    "text": "🐺 Avoidance / Counterdependency\nCan also be known as fear of intimacy or an avoidant attachment style. A counterdependent person keeps people at an emotional distance. They require a lot of time and space to themselves and are extremely independent. Can inadvertently push people away when they become close to someone else as vulnerability terrifies them.\nTypes of avoidance:\n\nOvert avoidance - people don’t show up to events because they are too uncomfortable.\n\nWhen people invite you out, and you don’t show up, they’re less likely to invite you out again; they don’t know you might be anxious and instead will take your actions to mean that you’re not interested in them (people assume rejection easily, we’ve found).\n\nCovert avoidance - showing up physically but checking out mentally. It is getting to the event but failing to engage with others, not making eye contact, talking really fast, and/or messing with your phone.\n\nSigns of avoidance:\n\nOver-intellectualization\n\nLeft-brain oriented (very logical)\nLack of interoception, chronic muscle tension\nOver-rely on self-regulation (routines, things, or activities) and under-rely on co-regulation\nProcessing emotions is less important than understanding why things happen the way they did\nDifficulty recognizing personal needs and self-regulating emotions\nPush away feeling with humor and disguise self-hatred with self-deprecating humor\n\nSocial difficulties\n\nConstant feelings of loneliness; isolated sense of self\nMight have different personalities for different people to avoid being “seen”\nDifficulty with eye contact\nPerfectionistic tendencies, high standards, hard on themselves\nOverwhelming need to be “seen”\n\nEmotionally distant\n\nDifficulty being vulnerable, and quickly feeling overwhelmed when people are vulnerable\nInability to ask for help, and discomfort accepting help from others\nDisinterest in the lives of others\nPreference for doing things yourself\nGet low rewards from and expect very little from relationships\nEmotionally regulate by themselves and not with others; tends to be autoregulating (more zoning/tuning out to dissociate from internal state than tuning into and working with internal state)\nFearful of being close to others; pushing people away when things become too serious\nDeactivation - strong emotional charge causes a person to withdraw or shutdown from relationships. Done as a way to stay safe and avoid further hurt. Triggers thoughts like “I shouldn’t be here” or “This person doesn’t care for me”.\nFaux vulnerability - sharing facts of a situation but not their thoughts or feelings.\n\n\nCauses of avoidance:\n\nIsolation - being left alone a lot in childhood, limited face to face time with caregivers\nLack of Presence - caregivers aren’t present enough; even if physically present they may not be emotionally and psychologically present\nTask-Based Presence - caregivers present only when teaching them something. Kids inherit belief of “I’m here for you, but only if you’re practical or functional.”\nAbsence of Touch - lack of touch in childhood from caregivers leads to “skin hunger” and avoidant tendencies\nEmotional Neglect - consistent nonresponsiveness to emotional needs from caregivers; see Jonice Webb’s work for more\nExpressive Dissonance - caregiver’s body language doesn’t match emotions, causing kids to have difficulty understanding and sending appropriate social cues\nDisrupted Engagement - either child or caregiver do not have secure attachment stimulated\nRejection - being outright rejected by caregivers in some form\n\nNeeds of an avoidant:\n\nLower emotional demand; fear of being emotionally smothered\n\nConsistency, safety, kindness, support, freedom\n\nAnalytical stimulation\nConstant learning\nValidation and feedback\n\nManage:\n\nSocial Growth\n\nRelax boundaries with people that are safe\nPractice sharing details of your life with others\nTell people how they made you feel, articulate feelings and needs\nAsk for help, and accept help if someone offers\nBecome more dependent and let people in more\nFocus on others\n\nStrategies\n\nCreate a daily ritual of checking in on your feelings, whether it be through journaling, meditation, or socializing.\nExplore body-based movements like yoga\nRemember emotions are temporary; be with your breath when they are intense\nPractice compassion for childhood self and accept flaws as an adult\nCreate meaningful self-narrative\n\nRelease from self-imposed prison - what do you need to do to earn self-respect so you can stop tormenting yourself?"

Either way, when you ignore boundaries you set with others, others think they can safely ignore your boundaries. Even though there are consequences to setting boundaries they are critical for maintaining self-respect.\nTypes of boundaries:\n\nPhysical boundaries\nMental boundaries\nResource boundaries\nIndividualistic boundaries\nCommunal boundaries\n\nGood boundaries to set:\n\nPrioritize what keeps you happy, healthy, and sane.\nSay no to stuff that doesn’t interest you\nLet calls go to voicemail\nWait before responding to a call, text, or email\nInform people of a decision rather than ask for permission\nTake mental health days as needed\nHave time-boxed hangouts for people that are good in small doses only, and limit settings for hanging out otherwise\nBlock people that really bother you\nPoint out when people do things you like and also things that hurt you\nDon’t engage in topics you don’t like\nAsk for help setting boundaries, and discuss boundaries and expectations otherwise\nDon’t share parts of your life with people you don’t want to be close to\nYou are not required to say yes to every social opportunity, especially if you are dreading it.\n\nHow to better set boundaries:\n\nSet boundaries earlier in a relationship rather than later, and stringent boundaries are easier to loosen than looser boundaries are to tighten\nUse the emotional bandwidth (scale of 1-10) to indicate what level of communication you can handle (mindless to heavy in terms of content)\nYou are not responsible for your parents’ emotional wellbeing. They are independent adults who have been on this earth for many more years than you.\n“You don’t attract the wrong people, you’re just not good at filtering out the people who aren’t good for you. It’s ok to say no.”\n“Why do you make people more comfortable when you are uncomfortable” (people pleasing and fawning)\n\nRelated - “don’t set yourself on fire to keep others warm”\n\n“why are you giving your power away?”\nPeople pleasing should be thought of as self-abandonment\n“There is a difference between being kind and being a doormat.”\nTranslate negative self-talk to understand what it’s really trying to tell you\n“When you let someone break your boundaries over and over again, it wasn’t them breaking your boundaries anymore. It was you breaking your boundaries.”\nHaving beliefs about relationships like:\n\nFeeling safe saying no to others\nMeeting your own needs if others say no to you\nHaving a strong sense of self/identity\nRespecting yourself\nTreating others with respect\nNot compromising who you are to avoid rejection\nFeeling safe asking for help and space when needed\nBeing in charge of your emotions and happiness, and letting others be responsible for theirs\nTaking responsibility for your failures and mistakes\nKnowing feelings and needs, and feeling safe communicating feelings and needs to others"

Let us assume he can do five simple tricks—he can pull a rabbit out of his hat, he can make a coin disappear, he can turn the ace of spades into the Joker card, and two others in a similar vein. These are his only tricks and he can’t learn any more; he can only do these five. HOWEVER, it turns out he’s doing these five tricks with real magic. It’s not an illusion; he can actually conjure the bunny out of the ether and he can move the coin through space. He’s legitimately magical, but extremely limited in scope and influence. Would this person be more impressive than Albert Einstein?\nLet us assume a fully grown, completely healthy Clydesdale horse has his hooves shackled to the ground while his head is held in place with thick rope. He is conscious and standing upright, but completely immobile. And let us assume that—for some reason—every political prisoner on earth (as cited by Amnesty International) will be released from captivity if you can kick this horse to death in less than twenty minutes. You are allowed to wear steel-toed boots. Would you attempt to do this?\nLet us assume there are two boxes on a table. In one box, there is a relatively normal turtle; in the other, Adolf Hitler’s skull. You have to select one of these items for your home. If you select the turtle, you can’t give it away and you have to keep it alive for two years; if either of these parameters are not met, you will be fined 999 dollars by the state. If you select Hitler’s skull, you are required to display it in a semi-prominent location in your living room for the same amount of time, although you will be paid a stipend of 120 per month for doing so. Display of the skull must be apolitical. Which option do you select?\nGenetic engineers at Johns Hopkins University announce that they have developed a so-called “super gorilla.” Though the animal cannot speak, it has a sign language lexicon of over twelve thousand words, an I.Q. of almost 85, and—most notably—a vague sense of self-awareness. Oddly, the creature (who weighs seven hundred pounds) becomes fascinated by football. The gorilla aspires to play the game at its highest level and quickly develops the rudimentary skills of a defensive end. ESPN analyst Tom Jackson speculates that this gorilla would be “borderline unblockable” and would likely average six sacks a game (although Jackson concedes the beast might be susceptible to counters and misdirection plays). Meanwhile, the gorilla has made it clear he would never intentionally injure any opponent. You are commissioner of the NFL: Would you allow this gorilla to sign with the Oakland Raiders?\nYou meet your soul mate. However, there is a catch: Every three years, someone will break both of your soul mate’s collarbones with a Crescent wrench, and there is only one way you can stop this from happening: You must swallow a pill that will make every song you hear—for the rest of your life—sound as if it’s being performed by the band Alice in Chains. When you hear Creedence Clearwater Revival on the radio, it will sound (to your ears) like it’s being played by Alice in Chains. If you see Radiohead live, every one of their tunes will sound like it’s being covered by Alice in Chains. When you hear a commercial jingle on TV, it will sound like Alice in Chains; if you sing to yourself in the shower, your voice will sound like deceased Alice vocalist Layne Staley performing a capella (but it will only sound this way to you). Would you swallow the pill?\nAt long last, someone invents “the dream VCR.” This machine allows you to tape an entire evening’s worth of your own dreams, which you can then watch at your leisure. However, the inventor of the dream VCR will only allow you to use this device of you agree to a strange caveat: When you watch your dreams, you must do so with your family and your closest friends in the same room. They get to watch your dreams along with you. And if you don’t agree to this, you can’t use the dream VCR. Would you still do this?\nDefying all expectation, a group of Scottish marine biologists capture a live Loch Ness Monster. In an almost unbelievable coincidence, a bear hunter in the Pacific Northwest shoots a Sasquatch in the thigh, thereby allowing zoologists to take the furry monster into captivity. These events happen on the same afternoon. That evening, the president announces he may have thyroid cancer and will undergo a biopsy later that week. You are the front page editor of The New York Times: What do you play as the biggest story?\nYou meet the perfect person. Romantically, this person is ideal: You find them physically attractive, intellectually stimulating, consistently funny, and deeply compassionate. However, they have one quirk: This individual is obsessed with Jim Henson’s gothic puppet fantasy The Dark Crystal. Beyond watching it on DVD at least once a month, he/she peppers casual conversation with Dark Crystal references, uses Dark Crystal analogies to explain everyday events, and occasionally likes to talk intensely about the film’s “deeper philosophy.” Would this be enough to stop you from marrying this individual?\nA novel titled Interior Mirror is released to mammoth commerical success (despite middling reviews). However, a curious social trend emerges: Though no one can prove a direct scientific link, it appears that almost 30 percent of the people who read this book immediately become homosexual. Many of these newfound homosexuals credit the book for helping them reach this conclusion about their orientation, despite the fact that Interior Mirror is ostensibly a crime novel with no homoerotic content (and was written by a straight man). Would this phenomenon increase (or decrease) the likliehood of you reading this book?\nThis is the opening line of Jay McInerney’s Bright Lights, Big City: “You are not the kind of guy who would be in a place like this at this time of the morning.” Think about that line in the context of the novel (assuming you’ve read it). Now go to your CD collection and find Heart’s Little Queen album (assuming you own it). Listen to the opening riff to “Barracuda.” Which of these two introductions is a higher form of art?\nYou are watching a movie in a crowded theater. Though the plot is mediocre, you find yourself dazzled by the special effects. But with twenty minutes left in the film, you are struck with an undeniable feeling of doom: You are suddenly certain your mother has just died. There is no logical reason for this to be true, but you are certain of it. You are overtaken with the irrational metaphysical sense that—somewhere—your mom has just perished. But this is only an intuitive, amorphous feeling; there is no evidence for this, and your mother has not been ill. Would you immediately exit the theater, or would you finish watching the movie?\nYou meet a wizard in downtown Chicago. The wizard tells you he can make you more attractive if you pay him money. When you ask how this process works, the wizard points to a random person on the street. You look at this random stranger. The wizard says, “I will now make them a dollar more attractive.” He waves his magic wand. Ostensibly, this person does not change at all; as far as you can tell, nothing is different. But—somehow—this person is suddenly a little more appealing. The tangible difference is invisible to the naked eye, but you can’t deny that this person is vaguely sexier. This wizard has a weird rule, though—you can only pay him once. You can’t keep giving him money until you’re satisfied. You can only pay him one lump sum up front. How much cash do you give the wizard?\nEvery person you have ever slept with is invited to a banquet where you are the guest of honor. No one will be in attendance except you, the collection of your former lovers, and the catering service. After the meal, you are asked to give a fifteen-minute speech to the assembly. What do you talk about?\nFor reasons that cannot be explained, cats can suddenly read at a twelfth-grade level. They can’t talk and they can’t write, but they can read silently and understand the text. Many cats love this new skill, because they now have something to do all day while they lay around the house; however, a few cats become depressed, because reading forces them to realize the limitations of their existence (not to mention the utter frustration of being unable to express themselves). This being the case, do you think the average cat would enjoy Garfield, or would cats find this cartoon to be an insulting caricature? 15.You have a brain tumor. Though there is no discomfort at the moment, this tumor would unquestionably kill you in six months. However, your life can (and will) be saved by an operation; the only downside is that there will be a brutal incision to your frontal lobe. After the surgery, you will be significantly less intelligent. You will still be a fully functioning adult, but you will be less logical, you will have a terrible memory, and you will have little ability to understand complex concepts or difficult ideas. The surgery is in two weeks. How do you spend the next fourteen days?\nSomeone builds and optical portal that allows you to see a vision of your own life in the future (it’s essentially a crystal ball that shows a randomly selected image of what your life will be like in twenty years). You can only see into this portal for thirty seconds. When you finally peer into the crystal, you see yourself in a living room, two decades older than you are today. You are watching a Canadian football game, and you are extremely happy. You are wearing a CFL jersey. Your chair is surrounded by books and magazines that promote the Canadian Football League, and there are CFL pennants covering your walls. You are alone in the room, but you are gleefully muttering about historical moments in Canadian football history. It becomes clear that—for some unknown reason—you have become obsessed with Canadian football. And this future is static and absolute; no matter what you do, this future will happen. The optical portal is never wrong. This destiny cannot be changed. The next day, you are flipping through television channels and randomly come across a pre-season CFL game between the Toronto Argonauts and the Saskatchewan Roughriders. Knowing your inevitable future, do you now watch it?\nYou are sitting in an empty bar (in a town you’ve never before visited), drinking Bacardi with a soft-spoken acquaintance you barely know. After an hour, a third individual walks into the tavern and sits by himself, and you ask your acquaintance who the new man is. “Be careful of that guy,” you are told. “He is a man with a past.” A few minutes later, a fourth person enters the bar; he also sits alone. You ask your acquaintance who this new individual is. “Be careful of that guy, too,” he says. “He is a man with no past.” Which of these two people do you trust less?\nYou have won a prize. The prize has two options, and you can choose either (but not both). The first option is a year in Europe with a monthly stipend of $2,000. The second option is ten minutes on the moon. Which option do you select?\nYour best friend is taking a nap on the floor of your living room. Suddenly, you are faced with a bizarre existential problem: This friend is going to die unless you kick them (as hard as you can) in the rib cage. If you don’t kick them while they slumber, they will never wake up. However, you can never explain this to your friend; if you later inform them that you did this to save their life, they will also die from that. So you have to kick a sleeping friend in the ribs, and you can’t tell them why. Since you cannot tell your friend the truth, what excuse will you fabricate to explain this (seemingly inexplicable) attack?\nFor whatever the reason, two unauthorized movies are made about your life. The first is an independently released documentary, primarily comprised of interviews with people who know you and bootleg footage from your actual life. Critics are describing the documentary as “brutally honest and relentlessly fair.” Meanwhile, Columbia Tri-Star has produced a big-budget biopic of your life, casting major Hollywood stars as you and all your acquaintances; though the movie is based on actual events, screenwriters have taken some liberties with the facts. Critics are split on the artistic merits of this fictionalized account, but audiences love it. Which film would you be most interested in seeing?\nImagine you could go back to the age of five and relive the rest of your life, knowing everything that you know now. You will reexperience your entire adolescence with both the cognitive ability of an adult and the memories of everything you’ve learned form having lived your life previously. Would you lose your virginity earlier or later than you did the first time around (and by how many years)?\nYou work in an office. Generally, you are popular with your coworkers. However, you discover that there are currently two rumors circulating the office gossip mill, and both involve you. The first rumor is that you got drunk at the office holiday party and had sex with one of your married coworkers. This rumor is completely true, but most people don’t believe it. The second rumor is that you have been stealing hundreds of dollars of office supplies (and then selling them to cover a gambling debt). This rumor is completely false, but virtually everyone assumes it is factual. Which of these two rumors is most troubling to you?\nConsider this possibility:\n\n\nThink about deceased TV star John Ritter.\nNow, pretend Ritter had never become famous. Pretend he was never affected by the trappings of fame, and try to imagine what his personality would have been like.\nNow, imagine that this person—the unfamous John Ritter—is a character in a situation comedy.\nNow, you are also a character in this sitcom, and the unfamous John Ritter character is your sitcom father.\nHowever, this sitcom is actually your real life. In other words, you are living inside a sitcom: Everything about our life is a construction, featuring the unfamous John Ritter playing himself (in the role of your TV father). But this is not a sitcom. This is your real life. How would you feel about this?"

It’s about creating an environment where people feel comfortable expressing themselves, asking questions, and making mistakes without fear of punishment or humiliation.\nA related concept is creative interchange, which is a process where individuals or groups share ideas, perspectives, and experiences to foster innovation, understanding, and growth. It’s like a brainstorming session where everyone’s input is valued and can lead to new insights or solutions."

Any meaning applied to them comes from your mind.\nAppeal to Emotion - Manipulating an emotional response in place of a valid or compelling argument\n👮Argument from Authority - You are more concerned with the validity of the information rather than the person saying it; however, the status and credentials of an individual greatly influence your perception of that individual’s message\n🤷Argument from Ignorance - When you can’t explain something, you think focus on what you can prove; however when you are unsure of something, you are more likely to accept strange explanations\n🛬 Arrival Fallacy - thinking once you achieve a big objective you will experience a lot of happiness\n🗞️Availability Cascade - Tied to our need for social acceptance, collective beliefs gain more plausibility through public repetition\n👀Availability Heuristic - We tend to most easily recall what is salient, important, frequent, and recent; we are far less likely to believe something never seen or heard before\n🔥Backfire Effect - Disproving evidence sometimes has the unwarranted effect of confirming our beliefs\n🎢Bandwagon Thinking - Appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation\n➗Bayes Theorem - Describes the probability of an event, based on conditions that might be related to the event.

Being smart makes you more prone to confirmation bias\n🧑‍💼Conformity - It takes little more than an authority figure or social pressure to get you to obey because conformity is a survival instinct\n🗓️Consistency Bias - Unless you consciously keep tabs on your progress, you assume the way you feel now is the way you have always felt\n🎛️Control Fallacy - thinking you have no control when you probably do, or thinking you have a lot of control when you don’t have any\n📈Correlation does not equal causation - just because two events are associated with each other doesn’t mean one causes the other\n🧊Decision inertia - the tendency to continue to do nothing because not acting doesn’t incur any immediate costs\n➕Discounting the Positive - ignoring or invalidating good things/positive experiences that have happened to you\n👥Dunbar’s Number - the cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships (usually 150)\n😶‍🌫️Dunning-Kruger Effect - people with limited competence in a particular domain overestimate their abilities\n🪟Eisenhower Decision Matrix - what is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important\nEmotional Reasoning - judging yourself or your circumstances based on your emotions; just because you feel something, it must be true\n⤴️Exponential Mindset - Instead of thinking incrementally (one small step at a time), thinking exponentially (each step bigger than the one before it\n🦣Extinction Burst - Any time you quit something cold turkey, your brain will make a last-ditch effort to return you to your habit\nFallacy of Change - tying your happiness and success to someone else’s behavior, only happy if they change\nFallacy of Fairness - preemptively think or assume everything must be fair, letting yourself down\n😱Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) - A pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent\n😨Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt (FUD) - A disinformation strategy used in sales, marketing, public relations, politics and propaganda. FUD is generally a strategy to influence perception by disseminating negative and dubious or false information and a manifestation of the appeal to fear.\n1️⃣ First principles thinking - separate the underlying ideas or facts from any assumptions based on them\n🔮Fortune Telling - When you predict events will unfold in a particular way, often to avoid trying something difficult\n🕰️Fresh Start Effect - When there’s an event marking a division in time, it gives someone the sense they can start anew with a clean slate and distance themselves from past mistakes or regrets\n🌲Fundamental attribution error (FAE) - causes people to assume that other people’s actions are less affected by their environment than they actually are, and to assume that those actions are more affected by their personality than they actually are\n🎲Gambler’s Fallacy - probabilities of independent events do not change based on the previous outcomes\n🦾Gap vs Gain Thinking - Gap-thinking focuses on what is lacking or missing in a situation, and trying to close that gap.

Happens in almost every area in life, and the inverse also applies (one negative trait leads to assuming other negative traits).

Usually lacks a currency)\n\nThe economy you create for your story world will depend on its context. The type of economy depends on the amount of resources, labor, population, ability to distribute, and occasionally government/politics. For instance, if your story is set in a small, remote village, it is likely to have a barter economy, since the people can just trade among themselves. Of course, having a different economy than that would be an interesting spin to take with a remote village, but it would have to have enough explanation to make it work. As long as the economy makes sense (as with many other aspects of worldbuilding), you should be okay.\n\nHow equally is the wealth distributed, and by whom? (In a socialist government, I think the distribution of wealth is a lot more controlled by a capitalist government. In the United States, it seems that corporations control most of the wealth and that it’s not trickling down to the other classes. Many different factors can control distribution of wealth.) • What are the resources like around the area? If your people do not have something locally available, how do they get it? Do they use a substitute, or trade for it?\nWhat does this storyworld (or country) have the most of, when it comes to resources? Do they offer it to others, or trade it with others? And on the flip side, what is most in demand in this storyworld/country? And can the economy meet that demand?\nWhat’s the most important part of the economy, the part that keeps it afloat? Trading? Manufacturing? Labor?\nDoes this storyworld have currency? And if so, what is it like?\nIs this economy affected by inflation (the rise in price of goods/services) or deflation (the decrease in price of goods/services)? What other issues does this economy have? (No economy is ever perfect, there are always improvements to be made.)\nWhat do people (or your characters specifically) think about the economy? Does it have a big effect on them? Do they try to stay out of it? Do they think it’s corrupt?"

    "text": "Character Archetypes\n\nProtagonist\nThe protagonist is the character who drives the plot, pursues the main goal of the story, and usually changes or grows over the course of the film. A protagonist enters the film with a goal and by the end of the film, they either achieved that goal or did not. The protagonist’s character arc is defined by the pursuit of that goal. Classic examples of protagonists from film are Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter. All stories must have a protagonist, but not all stories need a hero.\nThree types of protagonists:\n\nHero - someone we can all relate to, and his downfall will fill us with pity and fear. The hero is the “good guy”—the type of virtuous protagonist the audience roots for and wants to succeed.\nAnti-hero - an unlikely protagonist who does not necessarily have virtuous or villainous qualities but who is able to behave heroically if the opportunity arises.\nVillain - the villain protagonist is the villain, an undeniable “bad guy,” is also driving the plot as the central character.\n\n\n\nMain Character\nThe main character (aka principal character) is a central character who acts as the audience surrogate—we experience the story through their eyes. The main character is involved in the story, interacts with the secondary characters, and is personally impacted by the plot’s main conflict. The main character and the protagonist are often, but not always the same character.\nReasons to separate main character and protagonist:\n\nUnrelatable Protagonist: If the audience is not able to relate to the protagonist, the main character can be a more relatable entry-point to the story. In Tim Burton’s adaption of Charlie and the Chocolate factory, Willy Wonka is the protagonist and drives the plot, but he is also misanthropic and too kooky to be relatable for the audience. Charlie, the main character, acts as the audience surrogate.\nPoint of View: A main character can act as a plot device to reveal greater truths about your protagonist. In The Great Gatsby, for example, we are able to see the protagonist, Jay Gatsby, as a flawed and dishonest man more clearly through the eyes of the main character, Nick Carraway.\nAdded irony: A separate main character creates irony or a juxtaposition. Atticus—an adult lawyer—is the protagonist of To Kill a Mockingbird, a story about a rape trial with grown-up themes. The story, however, is told through the eyes of the main character, Scout, Atticus’s young daughter. Scout’s innocence reveals the flawed moral values of society and the adults around her.\n\n\n\n💢 Antagonist\n\nVillain - evil character\nAntagonist - character that gets in the way of the character’s main goal\nObstacle - something that stands in the way of the main character\n\n\n\nStakes Characters\nFor each character ties to the POV character:\n\nWhat is the stake that your character has to that character?\nHow would your character’s success or failure affect that character?\nWhat happens to your character if something positive happens to that character?\nWhat happens to your character if something negative happens to that character?"

Should there be other ways?\nWhat can my players buy? Why?\nIs money too easy to get? Too hard? How can I change this?\nAre choices about earning and spending meaningful ones?\nIs a universal currency a good idea in my game, or should there be specialized currencies?\n\nBalance\n\nDoes my game feel right? Why or why not?\n\nAccessibility\n\nHow will players know how to begin solving my puzzle or playing my game? Do I need to explain it, or is it self-evident?\nDoes my puzzle or game act like something they have seen before? If it does, how can I draw attention to that similarity. If it does not, how can I make them understand how it does behave?\nDoes my puzzle or game draw people in and make them want to touch it and manipulate it? If not, how I can I change it so that it does?\n\nVisible Progress\n\nWhat does it mean to make progress in my game or puzzle?\nIs there enough progress in my game? Is there a way I can add more interim steps of progressive success?\nWhat progress is visible, and what progress is hidden? Can I find a way to reveal what is hidden?\n\nParallelism\n\nAre there bottlenecks in my design where players are unable to proceed if they cannot solve a particular challenge? If so, can I add parallel challenges for a player to work on when this challenge stumps them?\nIf parallel challenges are too similar, the parallelism offers little benefit. Are my parallel challenges different enough from each other to give players the benefit of variety?\nCan my parallel challenges be connected somehow? Is there a way that making progress on one can make it easier to solve the others?\n\nPyramid\n\nIs there a way all the pieces of my puzzle can feed into a singular challenge at the end?\nBig pyramids are often made of little pyramids—can I have a hierarchy of ever more challenging puzzle elements, gradually leading to a final challenge?\nIs the challenge at the top of my pyramid interesting, compelling, and clear? Does it make people want to work in order to get to it?\n\nPuzzle\n\nWhat are the puzzles in my game?\nShould I have more puzzles, or less? Why?\nDo I have any incongruous puzzles? How can I better integrate them into the game? (Use Lens #49, Elegance, to help do this).\n\nControl\n\nWhen players use the interface, does it do what is expected? If not, why not?\nIntuitive interfaces give a feeling of control. Is your interface easy to master or hard to master?\nDo your players feel they have a strong influence over the outcome of the game? If not, how can you change that?\nFeeling powerful = feeling in control. Do your players feel powerful? Can you make them feel more powerful somehow?\n\nPhysical Interface\n\nWhat does the player pick up and touch? Can this be made more pleasing?\nHow does this map to the actions in the game world? Can the mapping be more direct?\nIf you can’t create a custom physical interface, what metaphor are you using when you map the inputs to the game world?\nHow does the physical interface look under the Lens of the Toy?\nHow does the player see, hear, and touch the world of the game? Is there a way to include a physical output device that will make the world become more real in the player’s imagination?\n\nVirtual Interface\n\nWhat information does a player need to receive that isn’t obvious just by looking at the game world?\nWhen does the player need this information? All the time? Only occasionally? Only at the end of a level?\nHow can this information be delivered to the player in a way that won’t interfere with the player’s interactions with the game world?\nAre there elements of the game world that are easier to interact with using a virtual interface (like a pop-up menu, for instance) than they are to interact with directly?\n\nTransparency\n\nWhat are the player’s desires? Does the interface let the players do what they want?\nIs the interface simple enough that with practice, players will be able to use it without thinking?\nDo new players find the interface intuitive? If not, can it be made more intuitive, somehow? Would allowing players to customize the controls help or hurt?\nDoes the interface work well in all situations, or are there cases (near a corner, going very fast, etc.) when it behaves in ways that will confuse the player?\nCan players continue to use the interface well in stressful situations, or do they start fumbling with the controls or missing crucial information? If so, how can this be improved?\nDoes anything confuse players about the interface? On which of the six interface arrows is it happening?\nDo players feel a sense of immersion when using the interface?\nWhat kind of virtual interface is best suited to my physical interface? Pop-up menus, for example, are a poor match for a gamepad controller.\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat do players need to know at this moment?\nWhat do players want to know at this moment?\nWhat do you want players to feel at this moment? How can you give feedback that creates that feeling?\nWhat do the players want to feel at this moment? Is there an opportunity for them to create a situation where they will feel that?\nWhat is the player’s goal at this moment? What feedback will help them toward that goal?\n\nJuiciness\n\nIs my interface giving the player continuous feedback for their actions? If not, why not?\nIs second-order motion created by the actions of the player? Is this motion powerful and interesting?\nJuicy systems reward the player many ways at once.

The core values of Systemic Shame include:\n\nPerfectionism: Only endless, flawless work and accomplishment matters.\nIndividualism: Everything that we do we do completely alone.\nConsumerism: Who we are is what we buy and own. Wealth: The only power that matters is economic power over others. Personal responsibility: Change only happens through personal willpower and strength.\n\nThere are three levels:\n\nPersonal Shame - feelings of self-loathing over identity, limitations, or perceived failings. Leads to hiding yourself from others/avoidant tendencies, leading to interpersonal shame\nInterpersonal Shame - believing other people are unsafe/untrustworthy, and people are generally immoral. Leads to harshly judging the actions of others, being hyperindependent, focusing only on self-preservation/safety, and not accepting help from others.\nGlobal Shame - believing humanity is filled with selfish, apathetic, or morally “bad” people, feeling humanity isn’t even worth saving. Leads to being cynical and not trying to improve relationships or the community."

    "text": "🪄 Magic\n\nFirst of all, what is your magic? Is it an energy force? Is it the action of spirits? Is it just magic, plain and simply? Figure out what magic is within the context of your own story.\nAre there different types of magic? For instance, with bending, there are different elements of bending. These elements also have derivatives, and can be combined. If there are types of magic, what do these types do, and what are their differences?\nHow do people execute magic? Do they say words? Perform rituals? Use motions? Store magic and then release it? Manipulate it with their minds?\nIs magic a substance, or is it just something that exists? If it’s a substance, is it limited? Do people fight over it? Is it involved in the economy? How much is there?\nWhere does the magic come from? Is it sourced from the planet, or space? Is it from spirits or gods? Does it simply exist within the physical laws of your story world?\nAre there laws about the usage of magic? If so, what are they?\nHow is magic viewed in your storyworld? Is it something frowned upon? Is it kept secret? Is it illegal? Is it commonplace? Is it frowned upon/pitiable if you can’t use magic?\nDo people use magic in dueling/fighting? Is it a main part of their weapon systems, or is it just something that enhances them? Have there been wars conducted entirely with magic?\nHow is the magic distributed among the people? Can an average person use it, or is it limited to the elites? If it’s unfairly distributed, how is that accomplished? Do the elites restrain the magic and keep it from the common people?\nIs magic integrated into religion? If so, how? Are there religions centered around magic? Do people get magic from their gods, or spirits?\nWhat does the magic look like? Is it an invisible force that has different manifestations depending on the sort of spell? Is it a tangible sort of energy that has different colors?\nHow is magic involved with the day-to-day activities of a society? Is it highly integrated, and necessary? Or is it just something that enhances everyday life? Does it negatively impact the society?\n\n\nHard vs Soft Magic Systems\nFirst, we have hard magic. These are systems with defined rules and regulations. A hard magic system will have a clear set of boundaries to it. An earthbender can manipulate rocks but not fire. Generally, these rules can’t be broken, and the reader knows the rules.\nExamples include: Fullmetal Alchemist, The Mistborn Trilogy, and Avatar: The Last Airbender\nUse a hard magic system if:\n\nYou are going to use magic to solve problems\nYour audience is accustomed to the tropes of hard magic\nYou are okay with jumping through hoops to expand your system\nYour magic doesn’t convey a theme\n\nThen we have soft magic. These are systems of mysticism. A soft magic system doesn’t have hard and fast rules. It is wild and undefined. The reader can see it play out but is often unaware of the mechanics. Gandalf came back to life because he is a wizard. Rules can’t be broken if you never establish them.\nExamples include: Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia, and Game of Thrones.\nUse a soft magic system if:\n\nYou want to convey a theme through magic\nYou want to create a sense of wonder\nYou want the ability to expand easily\nYou want to be accessible to a broader audience\nYour magic won’t regularly be used to solve problems"

    "text": "⚙️ Technology\n\nEnergy\n\nHow does this world get their energy? Fossil fuels? Hydropower? Solar power? Biofuels? Wind power? Nuclear? A society that runs on a certain type of fuel probably does so because that resource is abundant there, so keep that in mind.\nHow much can they power with their current energy level? You might want to look up the efficiency of their power source, for this one (for instance, burning some fuels provides a lot more energy than others).\nHow dangerous is their energy source, and what are its costs/benefits for society?\nWhat’s the technology level required for this particular energy source? A medieval-level fantasy is not going to have the tech for solar power, unless you’ve figured out some way to explain it with magic.\nIs their power source renewable or non-renewable? If it’s non-renewable, like fossil fuels, they’re bound to run out sometime.\nDoes this power source produce waste, and if it does, where does it get stored (i.e. nuclear and fossil fuel energy)?\n\nMedical\n\nHow advanced is this society’s medical technology, and why? Again, keep this one realistic. A society that hasn’t developed electricity yet, for instance, is not going to have MRI machines.\nHow well can they control and cure diseases (such as the use of vaccines, medicines, etc)? The less medical technology they have, the more widespread disease will be.\nDo people trust the medical techniques that are commonly used, and why? (this calls anti-vaccine people to mind, who use their own unscientific ‘research’ and distrust peer-reviewed actual scientific studies) Does society have a negative intent with these medical techniques, or is it just people being paranoid?\nHow advanced is their medicine? Does it cause a lot of adverse side effects? Is it even effective at all (think of herbal remedies and such that may not actually work)?\nWhat’s used for medicine? Do they used plants themselves? Synthesized chemicals? Pills? Liquids?\nHow expensive is medical care? Do most people have access to it?\nHow safe is medical technology? Again with this one, the more technology exists, the safer medical procedures are likely to be.\n\nFood and Water\n\nWhat technology does this society use to farm/gather/produce food? Same with water.\nDo they rely on agriculture? If so, what plants do they grow? (hint: to survive, humans need carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins and minerals. So societies usually grow a carbohydrate source [a cereal grain], a protein/fat source [animals or legume plants], and vitamin and mineral sources [fruits and vegetables].)\nHow hard is it to produce food in that area? Flat areas with fertile soils tend to be the best for growing most things. Look up things that are grown in the kind of geography your society has.\nWhere does the water come from? Are they near a lake? A river? An aquifer (an underground source of water)? Do they distill salt water from the sea? How close is this water supply to running out (for instance, where I live, the aquifer will eventually run out)?\nHow polluted is the water? Is it safe to drink? What lives in it? How do they clean it?\n\nTransportation\n\nWhat do people use for transportation? Cars? Trains? Horses/other four-legged hooved things? Motorcycles? Trucks? Carriages? Look up what your particular transportation method requires in terms of energy/electricity, and make sure it makes sense with your technology level. Societies also generally utilize more than one kind of transporation, especially in cities.\nHow is their public transportation? The more crowded/compact the area, the more likely public transportation is going to be widely used. Rural, spaced-out areas tend to depend on cars, trucks, and occasionally long-distance trains.\nHow is their transportation powered? Most things run on fossil fuels these days, but there are electric cars, trains that are powered by electromagnets, etc. The first trains that developed came around before electricity and ran on steam power.\n\nInformation\n\nHow do people access their information? Does the internet or something like it exist? Other ways of sharing information include books, phones, radio, word of mouth, songs, etc.\nHow easy is it to learn about things? The lower the level of technology, the harder it is for everyone to access information (for instance, the internet makes this very easy).\nHow accurate is the information people are able to access? Since the rise of the internet, a lot of complete nonsense is very easy to find via a google search. People also might only be exposed to biased propaganda in their media, and that might be the only thing they know.\nHow does society view truth? Do they take the things they know as absolute dogma, or do they constantly question things and try to learn more?\n\nCommunication\n\nHow do people communicate? By mail? Phone? Fax? Radio? Telegraph? Internet? In person?\nHow fast is communication? This depends on the technology in question (obviously the Pony Express is not going to be as quick as a phone). Also, if an area is more spaced out, it will be more difficult for them to establish communications before electricity is invented.\nHow private are communications? Does the government listen in? Do other people? Who are those people? Can the communications technology be easily hacked? Are there ways for people to protect themselves?\n\nRecreation\n\nWhat kind of technology exists for people to have fun with? Things like amusement parks, hobbies, etc.\nWhat do people do for fun? Obviously, the lower the technology, the simpler it will be.\nIs investing in recreation technology a big part of the economy (in most countries, it definitely is. People like to be entertained)?\nHow dangerous is the technology? A thrill ride built in 2013 is likely to be safer than one built fifty years ago.\nWhat are some of the more dangerous/stupid things people do for fun?\n\nManufacturing\n\nHow do people make things? Are they mass-produced in assembly lines? Made by hand?\nWho works in the factories, if they exist? Are they people, or are they robots? How does this affect the employment rate?\nHow dangerous are manufacturing jobs? Robots may eliminate jobs for people, but those jobs might also have been dangerous in the first place. Jobs at the beginning of the industrial revolution were especially dangerous, especially since workers’ rights hadn’t been as well established back then.\nHow much pollution does this technology produce? Generally, when things are mass-produced in factories, a lot of waste gets created. Factories are dirty places, and although they’ve definitely improved over the years, they aren’t exactly green.\n\n\n\nSafety, access\n\nIt’s not just manufacturing technology that can be dangerous - all technology carries some level of danger for both the people who work with it up close, and sometimes, the people who use it.\nWhat short-term dangerous effects does this technology have? What about long-term? Do they affect people who work with them directly, or do they also affect the environment in general?\n\n\n\nAccess to technology\n\nHow easy is it to access the technologies in question? Richer people usually have access to better technology, and there can be a large disparity between classes.\nHow easy is it to use these technologies? Can just anyone use them, or do you need to be trained?\nWho is allowed to access which technologies? For instance, something more dangerous will probably have a restricted set of people working with it.\n\n\n\nSpeed of technological development\n\nHow fast is technology developing? Certain advancements (steam, electricity, the internet, etc.) have resulted in exponential technological growth.\nHas anyone tried to stop technological growth? If so, why?\nIs it going too fast, or too slow?\n\n\n\nHistory of technology\n\nWhat came before the technologies your society is currently using?\nHow did people live back then, and how were they affected by the development of that technology?\nWere groups of people disenfranchised as technology developed?\nAre working conditions better or worse than they were in past years?"

Here are some things to think about when you do this:\n\nWhat is the land like in that area? Different types of land grow different crops. For instance, flat areas that used to be prairies, such as the American Midwest, are particularly good for growing corn and soybeans. Swampy and wetter areas are better for growing rice. A quick google search of “foods grown in [insert climate of your choice here]” should help with that.\nHow do they meet their dietary needs? Even if your species isn’t human, it still needs to feed on something to create energy to run its body. As for humans, however - humans need carbohydrates, proteins, fat, and various vitamins/minerals. We get these from different sources, so in order to meet these needs, we must eat a varied diet. If your people are surviving on food that is either mostly carbs (something like rice or other grains) or mostly protein (something like meat or legumes), your people aren’t going to survive.\nAs for nutrients, here is a basic summary of where people get which chemicals they need to survive: Carbs - Grains, fruits, vegetables, anything with sugar or starch in it. Protein - legumes, meat, dairy products, nuts. Fat - mostly animal products, generally, especially meat (although avacados and oily foods like olives also contain fat/lipids). Vitamins and minerals - the vast majority of these come from vegetables and fruits, although some also can appear in animal products (like vitamin D milk).\nHow easy it to find enough food to survive, for the average person? This depends both on the technology of the society, as well as the economic structure. More advanced technology can mean that more food is being produced (such as giant commercial farms that produce massive amounts of corn), but if the economics aren’t quite right (the market is out of whack, making food prices too high, or there is rampant poverty despite the technology), it still can be hard for the average person to obtain food. On the other end is subsistence farming, where the person grows/raises their own food to survive, and only sells a little to outside sources (if any). If there isn’t any agriculture, people are probably hunters and gatherers instead, or they import their food from elsewhere.\nHow processed is the food? This, again, will depend on technology. Generally, it’s healthier to eat non-processed foods, but these foods also spoil much quicker, and aren’t practical if you want to keep your food in storage for a long time. Today, foods are given preservatives and/or pasteurized to keep out germs, as well as keep the food from spoiling. In the past, people used to use either salt or spices to keep their food from spoiling, as well as keeping the food cold (which we obviously still do today). If the foods are over-processed in your society, the amount of unnatural chemicals in the foods might also cause problems for your people and cause them to get sick. Another good thing to consider is how clean the places where your food is processed are.\nHow much of an environmental impact does the food have, and is it sustainable to gather/grow/hunt it this way? Humans often try to capitalize on a resource for large immediate gains, but if this is done too much, they may not be able to have that resource in the future. With populations of wild animals/plants, if they are hunted/harvested too much, not enough of them will live to reproduce to replenish the population. This can also have negative ecological impacts and reduce/increase numbers of other species (which may or may not have deleterious effects), because if one species is affected, the whole ecosystem gets affected. As for land, if land is farmed too much, the soil can often become infertile and void of nutrients, and the water supply can also deplete because of improper irrigation (for an example of what can happen if land is farmed far too much without proper care, just look at the 1930s Dust Bowl).\nWhat foods are cheaper, and which are more expensive? How healthy are these foods? Is unhealthy food cheaper, and does that create a problem? In urban America, there are places in cities called food deserts, which are usually located in poorer areas, where the only reasonable access to a food source is something like a convenience store, which does not provide adequate food to survive healthily on.\n\nThose are some things to think about regarding the production of food and what your people eat, but here are some things to think about in regard to what your people do with their food, once they have it (basically, different food customs):\n\nWhat are the delicacies in your society? Usually, these are foods that are very rare and expensive (although they may or may not be delicious…I don’t think caviar is especially appetizing myself). Generally, they are mostly enjoyed by wealthier people (or people of lesser income on special occasions), so these are likely to appear either at gourmet restaurants, or at celebrations of some kind or another.\nWhat are some forbidden foods in your society, and why are they forbidden? A food may be banned because it causes extreme health problems, or that it’s morally objectionable to grow/hunt/raise it. For instance, many people find veal objectionable as a meat source. Food can also be forbidden for religious reasons, and if there are forbidden foods in a religion, it’s usually outlined in their scripture somewhere. Food can be forbidden for other reasons specific to your story, but these are some of the most common reasons.\nWhat foods are traditional on which holidays? Most societies have holidays of some sort, whether secular or religious, and people usually eat quite a bit on these holidays. Alternatively, fasting could also be a tradition on a holiday, although this would usually be associated with a religious holiday.\nWhat are considered some of the most delicious foods in your society? Cultures definitely differ in that regard, and many cultures consider certain foods delicious that another culture might find repulsive.\nHow much has the local food been influenced by food from other places/cultures? Has the local food tradition spread to other places? For instance, in America, we have a lot of restaurants that serve food traditional to other countries, but some do it better than others. I don’t think anyone really considers Taco Bell to be actual Mexican food, but there are other restaurants in America that serve legitimate and less Americanized Mexican food. • Do the people take pride in their food and the way it’s developed? Has your culture/country produced any notable specialties, especially ones that are easily recognizable?\nWhat are some of the traditional dishes of your culture/country, whether they are breakfast, lunch, dinner, desserts, or snacks? Usually, these will be based on which foods are most easily obtainable in your particular area (for instance, a lot of Italian food uses tomatoes, because tomatoes are easily grown in the Mediterranean region).\nWhat are the traditional mealtimes? Usually, people have about three meals a day, but this can vary. Maybe your people have one giant meal and the occasional snack, or they engage in more of a “grazing” behavior by having three or more small meals throughout the day. Are there any ceremonies involved with these mealtimes, or traditional drinks/foods eaten at specific times?\nWhat are some seasonal foods? What’s popular in winter, as opposed to summer (or whatever other seasons your region may have)? And why? Does this have to do with holidays that are in this particular season, or just the weather?\nWhat kind of drinks are there, and when are they consumed? These can range among water, juice, milk, tea, coffee, carbonated drinks, alcohol, etc. Nearly every society has some sort of intoxicating drink, so what kind of alcohol is favored by your society, and what it is made of (alcohol is made from fermented things, but these can range from grains to grapes to apples. It depends on the drink).\n\n\n\n🪽 Mythology\nMythologies – archetypal stories about specific peoples, places, histories, cultural practices – are an important part of worldbuilding if your characters live in a world that has literature, language, arts and culture.\n\nWhat are important morals or lessons people must recall with the help of fables and mythologies?\nWhat role(s) does mythology play in your world (e.g. sharing and upholding values, cautioning against destructive behaviors, etc.).\nWho are the most important figures in myths and legends in this world?\nWho writes or is keeper of mythologies and mythological tradition? Does each teller embellish or change the story, or is mythology fairly stable?\nWhere did the best-known myths and legends originate?\nWhere are the most important landmarks or other geographical features associated with world mythologies?\nWhen did the most popular myths originate and how have they changed over time?\nWhen are myths or legends typically told or shared?\nWhy were myths and legends created, to what end?\nWhy are specific creatures, animals or symbols prominent in this world’s myths and legends?\n\n\n\nProverbs Idioms, & Sayings\nWhile discussing communication, it’s also worth mentioning proverbs, idioms and sayings. The way people draw figurative language from their world tells us about the world and people’s relationship to it. For example, there is an expression in the South African language isiXhosa, the question ‘unomsila?’ (do you have a tail?), stated when someone enters a room but forgets to close the door behind them. It speaks to a country where wildlife plays an important part in myth and storytelling.\n\nWhat proverbs (e.g. the English saying, ‘Too many cooks spoil the broth’) are used in this world?\nWhat sayings have been inspired by practices, landmarks, fauna and flora or popular figures in this world?\nWho are the writers, storytellers, or others who have coined or help to spread sayings and figurative expressions?\nWho is most likely to know or use proverbs, idioms, culture-specific sayings?\nWhere do sayings and expressions primarily draw their inspiration from in this world?\nWhere are cultural or regional variations in expressions most apparent?\nWhen have particular expressions or sayings grown popular or fallen out of favor, and why?\nWhen is it appropriate or inappropriate to use a specific expression or form of speech?\nWhy do specific sayings, proverbs or expressions resonate with this world’s inhabitants?\nWhy have sayings, proverbs and idioms changed or adapted over time? What factors have influenced language’s development?\n\n\n\n♀️ Race, Gender, & Sexuality\nRace, gender and sexuality are sensitive topics but also extremely relevant to our own history on Earth. They are sites of rich identity expression, as well as violence and suppression. Race in the fantasy and sci-fi sense can of course refer to humans along with various ‘others’ who populate secondary worlds, from alien beings to elves and orcs.\n\nWhat is the history of race and gender in this world? Who has it benefitted or privileged, or does neither concept exist in quite the same way they have on Earth?\nWhat are commonly held beliefs about gender, race, orientation and other aspects of identity? If these beliefs differ between regions, what pressures (political, environmental, economic) contribute?\nWho holds more or less power on account of their race, gender, orientation or another aspect of identity? Why?\nWho casts off the norms or cliches of these categories, and how? How does their society respond (by transforming, celebrating or ostracizing them?)\nWhere are the rules prescribed by identity the most repressive or the freest? Or is the world singularly utopian or dystopian?\nWhere do positive or negative beliefs about gender, race, orientation or other constructed aspects of identity come from (e.g., ideology, or economic utility to a specific group).\nWhen will attitudes about any category of identity change in the story (and why)?\nWhen is the story set in this world’s development and how does era or epoch explain rules or roles concerning identity (and who makes them)?\nWhy are gender, race, sexuality or other aspects in flux in this world (is rebellion brewing against specific laws or customs, for example?)\nWhy are gender, race, sexuality or other aspects of identity important in this world’s history?"

    "text": "🎮 JRPG Cliches\n\nSleepyhead Rule - The teenaged male lead will begin the first day of the game by oversleeping, being woken up by his mother, and being reminded that he’s slept in so late he missed meeting his girlfriend.\n“No! My beloved peasant village!” - The hero’s home town, city, slum, or planet will usually be annihilated in a spectacular fashion before the end of the game, and often before the end of the opening scene.\nThinking With The Wrong Head (Hiro Rule) - No matter what she’s accused of doing or how mysterious her origins are, the hero will always be ready to fight to the death for any girl he met three seconds ago.\nCubic Zirconium Corollary - The aforementioned mysterious girl will be wearing a pendant that will ultimately prove to be the key to either saving the world or destroying it.\nLogan’s Run Rule - RPG characters are young. Very young. The average age seems to be 15, unless the character is a decorated and battle-hardened soldier, in which case he might even be as old as 18. Such teenagers often have skills with multiple weapons and magic, years of experience, and never ever worry about their parents telling them to come home from adventuring before bedtime. By contrast, characters more than twenty-two years old will cheerfully refer to themselves as washed-up old fogies and be eager to make room for the younger generation.\nSingle Parent Rule - RPG characters with two living parents are almost unheard of. As a general rule, male characters will only have a mother, and female characters will only have a father. The missing parent either vanished mysteriously and traumatically several years ago or is never referred to at all. Frequently the main character’s surviving parent will also meet an awkward end just after the story begins, thus freeing him of inconvenient filial obligations.\nSome Call Me… Tim? - Good guys will only have first names, and bad guys will only have last names. Any bad guy who only has a first name will become a good guy at some point in the game. Good guys’ last names may be mentioned in the manual but they will never be referred to in the story.\nNominal Rule - Any character who actually has a name is important in some way and must be sought out. However, if you are referred to as a part of a possessive noun (“Crono’s Mom”) then you are superfluous.\nThe Compulsories - There’s always a fire dungeon, an ice dungeon, a sewer maze, a misty forest, a derelict ghost ship, a mine, a glowing crystal maze, an ancient temple full of traps, a magic floating castle, and a technological dungeon.\nLuddite Rule (or, George Lucas Rule) - Speaking of which, technology is inherently evil and is the exclusive province of the Bad Guys. They’re the ones with the robots, factories, cyberpunk megalopolises and floating battle stations, while the Good Guys live in small villages in peaceful harmony with nature. (Although somehow your guns and/or heavily armed airships are exempted from this.)\nLet’s Start From The Very Beginning (Yuna Rule) - Whenever there is a sequel to an RPG that features the same main character as the previous game, that character will always start with beginner skills. Everything that they learned in the previous game will be gone, as will all their ultra-powerful weapons and equipment.\nPoor Little Rich Hero (Meis Rule) - If the hero comes from a rich and powerful family, it will have fallen on hard times and be broke and destitute by the time the game actually starts.\nThe Higher The Hair, The Closer To God (Cloud Rule) - The more outrageous his hairstyle, the more important a male character is to the story.\nGarrett’s Principle - Let’s not mince words: you’re a thief. You can walk into just about anybody’s house like the door wasn’t even locked. You just barge right in and start looking for stuff. Anything you can find that’s not nailed down is yours to keep. You will often walk into perfect strangers’ houses, lift their precious artifacts, and then chat with them like you were old neighbors as you head back out with their family heirlooms under your arm. Unfortunately, this never works in stores.\nHey, I Know You! - You will accumulate at least three of these obligatory party members:\n\nThe spunky princess who is rebelling against her royal parent and is in love with the hero.\nThe demure, soft-spoken female mage and healing magic specialist who is not only in love with the hero, but is also the last survivor of an ancient race.\nThe tough-as-nails female warrior who is not in love with the hero (note that this is the only female character in the game who is not in love with the hero and will therefore be indicated as such by having a spectacular scar, a missing eye, cyborg limbs or some other physical deformity – see The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly Rule.)\nThe achingly beautiful gothy swordsman who is riven by inner tragedy.\nThe big, tough, angry guy who, deep down, is a total softy.\nThe hero’s best friend, who is actually much cooler than the hero.\nThe grim, selfish mercenary who over the course of the game learns what it means to really care about other people.\nThe character who is actually a spy for the bad guys but will instantly switch to your side when you find out about it.\nThe weird bonus character who requires a bizarre series of side quests to make them effective (with the ultimate result that no player ever uses this character if it can be avoided.)\nThe nauseatingly cute mascot who is useless in all battles.\n\nHey, I Know You, Too! - You will also confront/be confronted by at least three of these obligatory antagonists:\n\nThe amazingly good-looking and amazingly evil long-haired prettyboy who may or may not be the ultimate villain.\nThe villain’s loyal right-hand man, who comes in two versions: humorously incompetent or annoyingly persistent.\nThe villain’s attractive female henchman, who is the strongest and most competent soldier in the army but always lets the party escape because she’s, yes, fallen in love with the hero.\nYour former ally who supposedly “died” and was forgotten about, until much later in the game when he/she shows up again on the villain’s side and full of bitterness.\nThe irritatingly honorable foe whom you never get to kill because, upon discovering the true nature of his superiors, he either nobly sacrifices himself or joins your party.\nThe insane clown or jester who will turn out to be surprisingly difficult to subdue.\nThe mad scientist who likes creating mutated creatures and powerful weapons ’cause it’s fun (and also handy if uninvited adventurers show up.)\nThe adorably cute li’l creature or six year old child who fights you and, inexplicably, kicks your butt time after time.\n\nHey, I Know You, Three! - Furthermore, expect to encounter most of the following obligatory non-player chararcters (NPCs):\n\nThe townsperson or crewmember who wanders aimlessly in circles and never quite gets where he is going.\nHilariously incompetent or cowardly soldiers.\nThe NPC who has a crush on another NPC and can’t quite work up the nerve to tell him or her, so instead tells every other person who wanders by about it at great length.\nA group of small children playing hide-and-seek.\nThe wise and noble captain/king/high priest.\nThe wise and noble captain/king/high priest’s splutteringly evil second-in-command. Nobody, including the hero, will notice the second’s constant, crazed scheming until the moment when he betrays everyone to the forces of badness.\nThe NPC who is obsessed with his completely mundane job and witters on endlessly about how great it is. He’s so thrilled by it that he wants to share it with everyone he sees, so given a quarter of a chance he’ll make you do his job for him.\nThe (adult) NPC who has nothing better to do than play kids’ games with passersby.\nThe group of young women who have formed a scarily obsessive fan club for one of your female party members.\n\nCrono’s Complaint - The less the main character talks, the more words are put into his mouth, and therefore the more trouble he gets into through no fault of his own.\n“Silly Squall, bringing a sword to a gunfight…” - No matter what timeframe the game is set in – past, present, or future – the main hero and his antagonist will both use a sword for a weapon. (Therefore, you can identify your antagonist pretty easily right from the start of the game just by looking for the other guy who uses a sword.) These swords will be far more powerful than any gun and often capable of distance attacks.\nJust Nod Your Head And Smile - And no matter how big that big-ass sword is, you won’t stand out in a crowd. Nobody ever crosses the street to avoid you or seems to be especially shocked or alarmed when a heavily armed gang bursts into their house during dinner, rummages through their possessions, and demands to know if they’ve seen a black-caped man. People can get used to anything, apparently.\nAeris’s Corollary - Just as the main male character will always use a sword or a variant of a sword, the main female character will always use a rod or a staff of some sort.\nMacGyver Rule - Other than for the protagonists, your choice of weapons is not limited to the prosaic guns, clubs, or swords. Given appropriate skills, you can cut a bloody swath across the continent using gloves, combs, umbrellas, megaphones, dictionaries, sketching tablets – you name it, you can kill with it. Even better, no matter how surreal your choice of armament, every store you pass will just happen to stock an even better model of it for a very reasonable price. Who else is running around the world killing people with an umbrella?\nO Brother, Where Art Thou? (Melfice Rule) - If the male hero has an older sibling, the sibling will also be male and will turn out to be one of the major villains. If the hero has a younger sibling, the sibling will be female and will be kidnapped and held hostage by the villains.\nCapitalism Is A Harsh Mistress - Once you sell something to a shopkeeper, he instantly sells it to somebody else and you will never see the item again no matter what.\nDimensional Transcendence Principle - Buildings are much, much larger on the inside than on the outside, and that doesn’t even count the secret maze of tunnels behind the clock in the basement.\nLocal Control Rule - Although the boss monster terrorizing the first city in the game is less powerful than the non-boss monsters that are only casual nuisances to cities later in the game, nobody from the first city ever thinks of hiring a few mercenaries from the later cities to kill the monster.\nNostradamus Rule - All legends are 100% accurate. All rumors are entirely factual. All prophecies will come true, and not just someday but almost immediately.\nIDKFA - The basic ammunition for any firearms your characters have is either unlimited or very, very easy to obtain. This will apply even if firearms are extremely rare.\nIndestructible Weapon Rule - No matter how many times you use that sword to strike armored targets or fire that gun on full auto mode it will never break, jam or need any form of maintenance unless it is critical to the story that the weapon breaks, jams or needs maintenance.\nSelective Paralysis - Your characters must always keep both feet on the ground and will be unable to climb over low rock ledges, railings, chairs, cats, slightly differently-colored ground, or any other trivial objects which may happen to be in their way. Note that this condition will not prevent your characters from jumping from railroad car to railroad car later in the game.\nBed Bed Bed - A good night’s sleep will cure all wounds, diseases, and disabilities, up to and including death in battle.\nYou Can’t Kill Me, I Quit (Seifer Rule) - The good guys never seem to get the hang of actually arresting or killing the bad guys. Minor villains are always permitted to go free so they can rest up and menace you again later – sometimes five minutes later. Knowing this rule, you can deduce that if you do manage to kill (or force the surrender of) a bad guy, you must be getting near the end of the game.\nAnd Now You Die, Mr. Bond! (Beatrix Rule) - Fortunately for you, the previous rule also applies in reverse. Rather than kill you when they have you at their mercy, the villains will settle for merely blasting you down to 1 hit point and leaving you in a crumpled heap while they stroll off, laughing. (This is, of course, because they’re already planning ahead how they’ll manipulate you into doing their bidding later in the game – see Way To Go, Serge.)\nZap! - Most villains in RPGs possess some form of teleportation. They generally use it to materialize in front of the adventurers when they reach the Obligatory Legendary Relic Room and seize the goodies just before you can. The question “if the bad guy can teleport anywhere at any time, then why doesn’t (s)he just zip in, grab the artifact, and leave before the adventurers have even finished the nerve-wracking puzzle on the third floor?” is never answered.\nHeads I Win, Tails You Lose (Grahf Rule) - It doesn’t matter that you won the fight with the boss monster; the evil task he was trying to carry out will still get accomplished somehow. Really, you might as well not have bothered.\nClockwork Universe Rule - No matter how hard you try to stop it, that comet or meteor will always hit the earth.\nFake Ending - There will be a sequence which pretends to be the end of the game but obviously isn’t – if for no other reason than because you’re still on Disk 1 of 4.\nYou Die, And We All Move Up In Rank - During that fake ending, the true villain of the story will kill the guy you’d thought was the villain, just to demonstrate what a badass he (the true villain) really is. You never get to kill the fake villain yourself.\n“What are we going to do tonight, Vinsfeld?” - The goal of every game (as revealed during the Fake Ending) is to Save the World from an evil figure who’s trying to take it over or destroy it. There is no way to escape from this formidable task. No matter whether the protagonist’s goal in life is to pay off a debt, to explore distant lands, or just to make time with that cute girl in the blue dress, it will be necessary for him to Save the World in order to accomplish it. Take heart, though – once the world gets sorted out, everything else will fall into place almost immediately.\nZelda’s Axiom - Whenever somebody tells you about “the five ancient talismans” or “the nine legendary crystals” or whatever, you can be quite confident that Saving the World will require you to go out and find every last one of them.\nGeorge W. Bush Geography Simplification Initiative - Every country in the world will have exactly one town in it, except for the country you start out in, which will have three.\nFodor’s Guide Rule - In the course of your adventure you will visit one desert city, one port town, one mining town, one casino city, one magic city (usually flying), one medieval castle kingdom, one clockwork city, one martial arts-based community, one thieves’ slum, one lost city and one sci-fi utopia. On the way you’ll also get a chance to see the cave with rocks that glow from a natural energy source, the village populated with nonhuman characters, the peaceful village where everyone knows the latest news about the hero’s quest (see Guy in the Street Rule), the snow village, the magical forest/lake/mountain, the shop in the middle of nowhere, the fantastic-looking place with lots of FMVs just showing your entrance, the subtropical jungle island populated by friendly natives, the annoying cavern maze, and a place – any place – that was destroyed in some past disaster.\nMidgar Principle - The capital of the evil empire is always divided into two sections: a lower city slum filled with slaves and supporters of the rebellion, and an upper city filled with loyal fanatics and corrupt aristocrats.\nNot Invented Here - Trade of technology will not exist. One place in the world will have all the techno-gadgets while all the others will be harvesting dirt.\nLaw of Cartographical Elegance - The world map always cleanly fits into a rectangular shape with no land masses that cross an edge.\n¿Quien Es Mas Macho? (Fargo Rule) - Every powerful character you attempt to seek aid from will first insist upon “testing your strength” in a battle to the death.\nWe Had To Destroy The Village In Order To, Well, You Know The Rest (Selene Rule) - No matter what happens, never call on the government, the church, or any other massive controlling authority for help. They’ll just send a brigade of soldiers to burn your entire village to the ground.\nZidane’s Curse (or, Dirty Pair Rule) - An unlucky condition in which every major city in the game will coincidentally wind up being destroyed just after the hero arrives.\nMaginot Line Rule - It is easy to tell which city/nation is the next conquest of the Evil Empire: its streets are filled with citizens who brag that the Empire would never dare attack them, and would be easily defeated if it tried. (This smug nationalism always fails to take into account the Empire’s new superweapon.)\nShort Attention Span Principle - All bookshelves contain exactly one book, which only has enough text on it to fill up half a page.\nPlanet of the Apes Rule - All cities and countries have ancestors that were wiped out by their technological advances.\nInsomnia Rule - A “free stay at the inn” is never really free. Expect to be woken up in the middle of the night for a mandatory plot event.\nThe Bling-Bling Thing (Lemina Rule) - No matter how much money and treasure you acquire, the greedy member of your party will never be satisfied and won’t stop griping about the sorry state of the party’s finances.\nI Don’t Like Gears Or Fighting - There are always giant robots. Always.\nHoudini’s Postulate - Anyone, whether they are in the player’s party or not, who is placed in any kind of prison, fortress, cell, or detention block will escape immediately. Party members will be freed either by a small child they just happened to befriend earlier in the day or by an unexpected disaster that overcomes the enemy base, NPCs will be freed by the released party members, and villains will break out all by themselves because they’re such badasses. Once a person has escaped from jail, no attempt will be made by the police to recapture them in the future.\nZeigfried’s Contradiction - Just because someone is weird doesn’t mean they’re important.\nNatural Monopoly Rule - No city will have more than two shops, unless it is crucial to the story that there be a hundred vendors which you must visit in order (see You Always Travel In The Right Circles.) All of these shops will sell the same goods for the same price.\nBut They Don’t Take American Express - Every merchant in the world – even those living in far-off villages or hidden floating cities cut off from the outside world for centuries, even those who speak different languages or are of an entirely different species – accepts the same currency.\nApathy Principle - Your group is the only bunch of people trying to save the world. All other would-be heroes will either join your party or else turn out to be cowards and/or con men.\nThe Good, The Bad, And The Ugly Rule\n\nAny male character who is ugly, malformed, or misshapen is either evil or so moral, spiritual, and/or wise that it’s a wonder no one’s proposed him for sainthood yet.\nAny male character who has a physical dysfiguration that doesn’t seem to impede him (i.e. a prominent scar across the face or a bad eye) is evil, unless he is the male lead, since scars are cool and no other good guy can be as cool as the hero. An exception is made for characters who are clearly ancient, and therefore automatically not as cool as the young hero.\nAny female character who is ugly, malformed, misshapen, or physically disfigured is evil, since all good female characters are there to be potentially seduced by the male lead – see Know Your Audience.\n\n\n\n\nHenchman Quota (Nana, Saki, and Mio Rule) - One of your antagonists will have three lovably incompetent stooges whom you fight over and over again. Although they’re trusted with their boss’s most important plans and equipment, they will screw up repeatedly, argue incessantly among themselves, blab secret information, and generally only come out victorious when their job was to be a diversion or a delaying tactic. A high point of the game will come when the True Villain reveals himself and you’re able to convince the stooges you’re all on the same side. They won’t help you out any more successfully than they helped the antagonist, but at least you won’t have to fight them any more.\nThousand Year Rule - The Ancient Evil returns to savage the land every thousand years on the dot, and the last time it showed up was just about 999.9875 years ago. Despite their best efforts, heroes of the past were never able to do more than seal the Evil away again for the future to deal with (which brings up the question of just how exactly does this “sealing away” work anyway, but never mind.) The good news is that this time, the Evil will get destroyed permanently. The bad news is that you’re the one who’s going to have to do it.\nPrinciple of Narrative Efficiency - If the main villain (or the enemy you’ve been trying to kill for most of the game before he summons the real final villain) was ever defeated in the past by another group of adventurers, one of them will secretly be in your party and one of them will be the hero’s father.\nAyn Rand’s Revenge - Outside the major cities, there is no government whatsoever. Of course, perhaps that explains why it’s so difficult and dangerous to get anywhere outside the major cities.\nFirst Law of Travel - Anything can become a vehicle – castles, cities, military academies, you name it – so do not be alarmed when the stones of the ancient fortress you are visiting shake underfoot and the whole thing lifts off into the sky. As a corollary, anything is capable of flight if it would be cool, aeronautics or even basic physics be damned.\nSecond Law of Travel - There will be only one of any non-trivial type of vehicle in the entire world. Thus, only one ocean-capable steamboat, only one airship, and so forth. Massive facilities will have been constructed all over the world to service this one vehicle.\nThird Law of Travel - The only way to travel by land between different areas of a continent will always be through a single narrow pass in a range of otherwise impenetrable mountains. Usually a palace or monastery will have been constructed in the pass, entirely filling it, so that all intracontinental traffic is apparently required to abandon their vehicles and go on foot up stairs and through the barracks, library and throne room to get to the other side. This may explain why most people just stay home. (In some cases a cave or underground tunnel may be substituted for the palace or monastery, but it will still be just as inconvenient with the added bonuses of cave-ins and nonsensical elevator puzzles.)\nFourth Law of Travel - Three out of every four vehicles you ride on will eventually sink, derail or crash in some spectacular manner.\nFifth Law of Travel - All vehicles can be driven or piloted by anyone. The main character just needs to find out where the bridge or steering wheel is, as he already knows all of the controls.\nSixth Law of Travel - Nobody gets to own a cooler ride than you. If you ever do see a cooler vehicle than the one you’ve got now, at some point before the end of the game you will either take over this vehicle, get something even bigger and better, or else see it destroyed in a glorious blaze.\nSeventh Law of Travel - When on a voyage to another continent, the journey will last only as long as it takes you to talk to all the other passengers and the captain.\nEighth Law of Travel - There are no shortcuts, ever – unless you are forced to take them, in which case they will be much longer and more dangerous than your original route.\nLast Law of Travel (Big Joe Rule) - As has been described, you must endure great trials just to get from town to town: locating different vehicles, operating ancient transport mechanisms, evading military blockades, the list goes on. But that’s just you. Every other character in the game seems to have no trouble getting to any place in the world on a moment’s notice.\nIf You Meet The Buddha In A Random Encounter, Kill Him! - When you’re out wandering around the world, you must kill everything you meet. People, animals, plants, insects, fire hydrants, small cottages, anything and everything is just plain out to get you. It may be because of your rampant kleptomania (see Garrett’s Principle.)\nLaw of Numbers - There will be several items or effects which depend on the numerical value of your hit points, level, etc., which makes no sense unless the characters can see all the numbers in their world and find it perfectly normal that a spell only works on a monster whose level is a multiple of 5.\nMagical Inequality Theorem - In the course of your travels you may find useful-sounding spells such as Petrify, Silence, and Instant Death. However, you will end up never using these spells in combat because a) all ordinary enemies can be killed with a few normal attacks, making fancy attacks unneccessary, b) all bosses and other stronger-than-average monsters are immune to those effects so there’s no point in using them for long fights where they’d actually come in handy, and c) the spells usually don’t work anyway.\nMagical Inequality Corollary - When the enemy uses Petrify, Silence, Instant Death, et cetera spells on you, they will be effective 100% of the time.\nPretty Line Syndrome (or, Crash Bandicoot: The RPG) -Seen in most modern RPGs. The key to completing your quest is to walk forward in a straight line for fifty hours, stopping along the way to look at, kill, and/or have meaningful conversations with various pretty things.\nXenobiology Rule - The predatory species of the world will include representatives of all of the following: giant spiders, giant scorpions, giant snakes, giant beetles, wolves, squid, fish that float in midair, gargoyles, golems, carnivorous plants, chimeras, griffons, cockatrices, hydras, minotaurs, burrowing things with big claws, things that can paralyze you, things that can put you to sleep, things that can petrify you, at least twenty different creatures with poisonous tentacles, and dragons. Always dragons.\nFriendly Fire Principle (or, Final Fantasy Tactics Rule) - Any attack that can target both allies and enemies will hit half of your allies and none of your enemies.\nDungeon Design 101 - There’s always goodies hidden behind the waterfall.\nDungeon Design 102 - When you are confronted by two doors, the closer one will be locked and its key will be hidden behind the farther-away one.\nDungeon Design 103 (or, Wallpaper Warning) - Your progress through a dungeon will be indicated by a sudden change in decor: different wall color, different torches on the wall, et cetera.\nDungeon Design 201 (or, The Interior Decorators Anticipated Your Out-Of-Body Experience) - Most dungeons will include “hidden” passages which are nearly impossible to see from a bird’s-eye view, yet would be blaringly obvious from the party’s perspective.\nDungeon Design 301 - All “puzzles” in RPG dungeons can be sorted into one of the following types:\n\nfinding some small item and sticking it into a slot;\npushing blocks (rocks, statues) onto switches;\npulling switches or levers to open and close doors;\nlearning the correct order/position of a group of objects;\nentering a certain combination of doors;\nsomething involving a clock or elevator;\nsomething that is unsolvable because a vital clue in the dialogue was mistranslated out of Japanese.\n\nWait! That Was A Load-Bearing Boss! - Defeating a dungeon’s boss creature will frequently cause the dungeon to collapse, which is nonsensical but does make for thrilling escape scenes.\nSupply and Demand Axiom - Killing a powerful enemy will usually yield an item or weapon that would’ve been extremely useful if you had gotten it before killing that enemy.\nEdison’s Lament - No switch is ever in the right position.\nWell, That About Wraps It Up For God - All major deities, assuming they actually exist and weren’t just made up by the Church to delude its followers, are in reality malevolent and will have to be destroyed. The only exception to this rule is the four nature spirits who have preserved the land since time immemorial, but now due to the folly of mankind have lost virtually all of their power and need you to accomplish some ludicrous task to save them.\nGuy in the Street Rule - No matter how fast you travel, rumors of world events always travel faster. When you get to anywhere, the people on the street are already talking about where you’ve been. The stories of your past experiences will spread even if no witnesses were around to see them.\nWherever You Go, There They Are - Wherever the characters go, the villains can always find them. Chances are they’re asking the guy in the street (see above). But don’t worry – despite being able to find the characters with ease anytime they want to, the bad guys never get rid of them by simply blowing up the tent or hotel they’re spending the night in. (Just think of it: the screen dims, the peaceful going-to-sleep-now music plays, then BOOM! Game Over!)\nFigurehead Rule - Whenever someone asks you a question to decide what to do, it’s just to be polite. He or she will ask the question again and again until you answer “correctly.”\nPuddin’ Tame Rule - The average passer-by will always say the same thing no matter how many times you talk to them, and they certainly won’t clarify any of the vaguely worded warnings or cryptic half-sentences they threw at you the previous time.\nFranklin Covey Was Wrong, Wrong, Wrong - Sticking to the task at hand and going directly from place to place and goal to goal is always a bad idea, and may even prevent you from being able to finish the game. It’s by dawdling around, completing side quests and giving money to derelicts that you come into your real power.\nSelective Invulnerability Principle - RPG characters are immune from such mundane hazards as intense heat, freezing cold, or poison gas… except when they’re suddenly not. Surprise!\nI’m the NRA (Billy Lee Black Rule) - Opposition to gun control is probably the only thing you could get all RPG characters to agree upon. Even deep religious faith and heartfelt pacifism can’t compete with the allure of guns.\nThree Females Rule - There will always be either one or three female characters in the hero’s party, no matter how many male characters there are.\nExperience Not Required - When the main character is forced to do some complex or dangerous task for the first time, even though he has never done it before he will still always be better than the oldest veteran.\nLaw of Reverse Evolution (Zeboim Principle) - Any ancient civilizations are inexplicably much more advanced than the current one.\nScience-Magic Equivalence (Citan Rule) - Although mages’ specialty is magic and scientists’ specialty is technology, these skills are completely interchangeable.\nLaw of Productive Gullibility (Ruby Rule) - Whenever anybody comes up to you with a patently ludicrous claim (such as, “I’m not a cat, I’m really an ancient Red Dragon”) there’s an at least two-thirds chance they’re telling the truth. Therefore, it pays to humor everyone you meet; odds are you’ll be glad you did later on.\nPerversity Principle - If you’re unsure about what to do next, ask all the townspeople nearby. They will either all strongly urge you to do something, in which case you must immediately go out and do that thing, or else they will all strongly warn you against doing something, in which case you must immediately go out and do that thing.\nNear-Death Epiphany (Fei Rule) - If the party is not dealing damage to a boss character, then there’s a better-than-even chance that someone in the party will suddenly become enlightened and instantly acquire the offensive skill that can blow the creature away in a matter of seconds.\nWutai Rule - Most RPGs, no matter what their mythology, include a land based on ancient Japan. Full of pagodas, shrines, shoguns, kitsune, and sushi, this completely anachronistic place is the source of the entire world’s supply of ninja and samurai characters.\nLaw of Mooks - Soldiers and guards working for the Evil Empire are, as a rule, sloppy, cowardly and incompetent. Members of the heroic Resistance Faction are, as a rule, dreadfully weak and undertrained and will be wiped out to the last man the moment they come in contact with the enemy.\nLaw of Traps - No matter how obvious the trap, you can’t complete the game unless you fall into it.\nArbor Day Rule - At some point, you’re going to have to talk to a tree and do what it says.\nYou Do Not Talk About Fight Club - Any fighting tournament or contest of skill you hear about, you will eventually be forced to enter and win.\nInvisible Bureaucracy Rule - Other than the royal family, its shifty advisor, and the odd mad scientist, the only government employees you will ever encounter in the course of your adventure are either guards or kitchen staff.\nThe Miracle of Automation - Similarly, any factory, power plant, or other facility that you visit during the course of the game will be devoid of any human life except for the occasional guards. There will not be a single line worker or maintenance person in sight.\nPrinciple of Archaeological Convenience - Every ancient machine you find will work perfectly the first time you try to use it and every time thereafter. Even if its city got blasted into ruins and the machine was then sunk to the bottom of the sea and buried in mud for ten thousand years, it’ll still work fine. The unfortunate corollary to this rule is that ancient guardian creatures will also turn out to be working perfectly when you try to filch their stuff.\nThey Don’t Make ’Em Like They Used To (Cid Rule) - Modern-day machinery, by contrast, will always break down at the worst possible moment (for example, when you only need one more shot from the giant cannon to defeat the final boss.)\nPlace Transvestite Joke Here (Miss Cloud Rule) - If the male lead is required to dress up like a girl for any reason, he will be regarded by everyone as much more attractive than any “real” girl. If the female lead cross-dresses as a man, she will be immediately recognized as who she is by everyone except the male lead and the main villain.\nMake Room! Make Room! - There are always more people in a town or village than there are houses for them to live in. Most of the village is made up of shops, temples, bars, secret passages, inns, and the mansion that belongs to the richest man in town.\nLaw of Scientific Gratification - If the hero needs a new invention to progress, he will find out that somewhere in the world someone has spent his or her entire life perfecting this invention, and usually just needs one more key item located in a monster-infested dungeon before it is completed.\nYou Always Travel In The Right Circles - Whenever you meet a villager or other such incidental character who promises to give you some great piece of needed knowledge or a required object in exchange for a seemingly simple item, such as a bar of soap or a nice straw mat, be prepared to spend at least an hour chasing around the world exchanging useless innocuous item after item with bizarre strangers until you can get that elusive first item you were asked for.\nTalk Is Cheap Rule - Nothing is ever solved by diplomacy or politics in the world of RPGs. Any declarations of peace, summits and treaty negotiations are traps to fool the ever so gullible Good Guys into thinking the war is over, or to brainwash the remaining leaders of the world.\nStop Your Life (Setzer Rule) - No matter what kind of exciting, dynamic life a character was leading before joining your party, once there they will be perfectly content to sit and wait on the airship until you choose to use them.\nDon’t Stand Out - Any townsperson who is dressed oddly or otherwise doesn’t fit in with the rest of the townsfolk will either: 1. Join your party after you complete some task, 2. Be in the employ of your enemy, or 3. Befriend any female member of the party, and then be immediately captured and held hostage by the villains.\nLittle Nemo Law - If any sleeping character has a dream, that dream will be either a 100% accurate memory of the past, a 100% accurate psychic sending from the present, a 100% accurate prophetic vision of the future, or a combination of two or all three of these.\nChild Protection Act (Rydia Rule) - Children 12 and under are exempt from death. They will emerge alive from cataclysms that slaughter hundreds of sturdily-built adults, often with barely a scratch. Further protection is afforded if the catastrophe will orphan the child.\nMissing Master Hypothesis - Almost every strong physical fighter learned everything he/she knows from some old master or friend. Invariably, the master or friend has since turned evil, been killed, or disappeared without a trace.\nMissing Master Corollary (Sabin Rule) - If a fighter’s master merely disappeared, you will undoubtedly find him/her at some point in your travels. The master will challenge the student to a duel, after which the student will be taught one final skill that the master had been holding back for years.\nGojira Axiom - Giant monsters capable of leveling cities all have the following traits:\n\nLow intelligence\nEnormous strength\nProjectile attacks\nGigantic teeth and claws, designed, presumably, to eat other giant monsters\nVulnerable to weapons 1/10,000th its size\nEcologically sensitive\n\n“You Couldn’t Get To Sleep Either, Huh?” - If any character in the game ever meets any other character standing alone at night looking at the moon, those two will eventually fall in love.\nAbsolute Power Corrupts Absolutely (Althena Rule) - If a good guy is manipulated to the side of evil, they will suddenly find a new inner strength that will enable them to wipe out your whole party with a wave of their hand.\nAll Is Forgiven (Nash Rule) - However, when the trusted member of your party turns against you, do not give it a second thought. They will return to your side after they’re done with their amnesia/mind control/hidden noble goal that caused them to give away all your omnipotent mystical artifacts.\nFirst Law of Fashion - All characters wear a single costume which does not change over the course of the game. The only exception is when characters dress up in enemy uniforms to infiltrate their base.\nSecond Law of Fashion - Any character’s costume, no matter how skimpy, complicated, or simply outlandish, is always completely suitable to wear when climbing around in caves, hiking across the desert, and slogging through the sewers. It will continue to be completely suitable right afterwards when said character goes to meet the King.\nThird Law of Fashion - In any futuristic setting, the standard uniform for female soldiers and special agents will include a miniskirt and thigh-high stockings. The standard uniform for all male characters, military or not, will include an extraordinarily silly and enormous hat.\nFirst Rule of Politics (Chancellor’s Axiom) - Any advisor of a major ruler has been scheming after his throne for quite a while. Thanks to the miracle of timing, you will arrive at the king’s inner sanctum just in time for the coup.\nSecond Rule of Politics (Scapegoat’s Axiom) - If the advisor works for an evil ruler, the advisor is as bad or even worse, and there’s a good chance he’s the final villain. (See Fake Ending Rule.) If the advisor works for a good ruler, he usually has the good of the kingdom at heart; not that that helps, because your party will invariably be made the scapegoat for all that’s wrong with the nation and immediately thrown in the dungeon.\nLast Rule of Politics - Kingdoms are good. Empires are evil.\nInheritance of Acquired Characteristics (Ramus Rule) - Twenty-three generations may pass, but any person’s direct descendant will still look and act just like him.\nPinch Hitter Rule - Whenever a member of the hero’s team is killed or retires, no matter how unique or special he or she was there is a good chance someone will show up to replace them that has exactly the same abilities and can use the same weapons with the same proficiency.\nDealing With Beautiful Women, Part 1 (Yuffie Rule) - All good-looking young females are there to help you. This rule holds even when the girl in question is annoying, useless, or clearly evil.\nDealing With Beautiful Women, Part 2 (Rouge Rule) - All good-looking middle-aged females are out to kill you. This rule holds even when the woman in question has attained your unwavering trust and respect.\nWell, So Much For That - After you have completed your mighty quest to find the object that will save the known universe, it will either a) get lost, b) get stolen, or c) not work.\nThe Ominous Ring of Land - The classic Ominous Ring of Land is a popular terrain feature that frequently doesn’t show up on your world map. Just when you think things are going really well and you’ve got the Forces of Evil on the run, monsters, demons and mad gods will pour out of the center of the ring and the situation will get ten times worse. The main villain also usually hangs out in one of these after attaining godhood. If there are several Ominous Rings of Land or the entire world map is one big ring, you are just screwed.\nLaw of NPC Relativity (Magus Rule) - Characters can accomplish superhuman physical feats, defeat enemies with one hand tied behind their back and use incredible abilities – until they join your party and you can control them. Then these wonderful powers all vanish, along with most of their hit points.\nGuards! Guards! (or, Lindblum Full Employment Act) - Everything will be guarded and gated (elevators, docks, old rickety bridges, random stretches of roadway deep in the forest) except for the stuff that actually needs to be.\nThank You For Pressing The Self-Destruct Button - All enemy installations and city-sized military vehicles will be equipped with a conveniently located, easy-to-operate self-destruct mechanism.\nFalling Rule - An RPG character can fall any distance onto anything without suffering anything worse than brief unconsciousness. In fact, falling a huge distance is an excellent cure for otherwise fatal wounds – anyone who you see shot, stabbed, or mangled and then tossed off a cliff is guaranteed to return later in the game with barely a scratch.\nMaterials Science 101 - Gold, silver, and other precious metals make excellent weapons and armor even though in the real world they are too soft and heavy to use for that purpose. In fact, they work so well that nobody ever melts their solid gold suit of armor down into bullion, sells it, and retires to a tropical isle on the proceeds.\nMaterials Science 201 - Everyone you meet will talk enthusiastically about how some fantastically rare metal (iron, say) would make the best possible armor and weapons. Oh, if only you could get your hands on some! However, once you actually obtain iron – at great personal risk, of course – everyone will dismiss it as yesterday’s news and instead start talking about some even more fantastically rare metal, such as gold. Repeat until you get to the metal after “mythril” (see The Ultimate Rule.)\nSeventh Inning Stretch (Elc Rule) - At some point in the game the main hero will receive a deadly story-driven injury and will be put in a hospital instead of having a mage heal him. This will leave him out of commission for at least the length of two sidequests; the female lead will also be temporarily out of commission as she steadfastly refuses to leave the hero’s side. Ultimately a simple vision quest is all that will be required to bring the hero back to normal.\nVivi’s Spellbook Principle - Over the course of the game, you will spend countless hours learning between twenty and one hundred skills and/or spells, approximately three of which will still be useful by the end of the game.\nGender Equality, Part 1 (Feena Rule) - Your average female RPG character carries a variety of deadly weapons and can effortlessly hack or magic her way through armies of monsters, killer cyborgs, and mutated boss creatures without breaking a sweat. She may be an accomplished ninja, a superpowered secret agent, or the world’s greatest adventurer. However, if one of the game’s villains manages to sneak up and grab her by the Standard Female Character Grab Area (her upper arm) she will be rendered utterly helpless until rescued by the hero.\nGender Equality, Part 2 (Tifa Rule) - If any female character, in a burst of anger or enthusiasm, decides to go off and accomplish something on her own without the hero, she will fail miserably and again have to be rescued.\nGender Equality, Part 3 (Luna Rule) - All of the effort you put into maxing out the female lead’s statistics and special abilities will turn out to be for naught when she spends the final confrontation with the villain dead, ensorcelled, or held hostage.\nGender Equality Addendum (Rynn Rule) - In the unlikely event that the main character of the game is female, she will not be involved in any romantic subplot whatsoever beyond getting hit on by shopkeepers.\nStealing The Spotlight (Edea Rule) - The characters who join your party only briefly tend to be much cooler than your regular party members.\n“Mommy, why didn’t they just use a Phoenix Down on Aeris?” - Don’t expect battle mechanics to carry over into the “real world.”\nGold Saucer Rule - The strongest weapons/items/spells in the entire game can only be found by doing things like racing birds.\nEvil May Live Forever, But It Doesn’t Age Well - Even though it took the greatest armies in the world and all of the world’s greatest magicians to seal away an ancient evil in an apocalyptic war, once said ancient evil breaks free three fairly inexperienced warriors can destroy it.\nSephiroth Memorial Escape Clause - Any misdeed up to and including multiple genocide is forgiveable if you’re cool enough.\nDoomed Utopia Theorem (Law of Zeal) - All seemingly ideal, utopian societies are powered by some dark force and are therefore doomed to swift, flashy destruction.\nParty Guidance Rule - Somewhere in the last third of the story, the hero will make a stupid decision and the rest of the party must remind him of all that they have learned from being with him in order to return the hero to normal.\nBad Is Good, Baby! - The heroes can always count on the support of good-hearted vampires, dragons, thieves, demons, and chainsaw murderers in their quest to save the world from evil. And on the other hand…\nGood Is Bad, Baby! - Watch out for generous priests, loyal military officers, and basically anyone in a position of authority who agrees to help you out, especially if they save your life and prove their sincerity innumerable times – they’re usually plotting your demise in secret (at least when they can fit it into their busy schedule of betraying their country, sponsoring international terrorism, and stealing candy from small children) and will stab you in the back at the most inconvenient moment, unless they fall under…\nGeneral Leo’s Exception - Honorable and sympathetic people who work for the Other Side are always the genuine article. Of course they’ll be busily stabbing you in the front, so either way you lose. Eventually though, they’ll fall prey to…\nThe Ineffectual Ex-Villain Theorem (Col. Mullen Rule) - No matter how tough and bad-ass one of the Other Side’s henchmen is, if he bails to the side of Good he’ll turn out to be not quite tough and bad-ass enough. The main villain will defeat him easily. But don’t weep – usually he’ll manage to escape just in time, leaving you to deal with the fate that was meant for him.\nAll The Time In The World (Rinoa Rule) - Unless there’s a running countdown clock right there on the screen, you have as long as you want to complete any task – such as, say, rescuing a friend who’s hanging by one hand from a slippery cliff edge thousands of feet in the air – no matter how incredibly urgent it is. Dawdle or hurry as you will, you’ll always make it just in the nick of time.\nLadies First (Belleza Rule) - When things really start falling apart, the villain’s attractive female henchman will be the first to jump ship and switch to the side of Good. Sadly, she still won’t survive until the end credits, because later she will sacrifice her life out of unrequited love for the villain.\nTrial By Fire (Cecil Rule) - Any dark and brooding main characters will ultimately be redeemed by a long, ardous, quasi-spiritual quest that seems difficult at the time, but in the great scheme of things just wasn’t that big of a deal after all.\nKey Item Rule - Never discard, sell, or otherwise remove permamently from your possession any items you begin the game with or acquire within the first town. This is especially true for items that seem to have no practical use, because of…\nThe Law of Inverse Practicality (Key Item Corollary) - Any item that you can acquire will have some sort of purpose. Those that seem to be useless and have no practical value at all, always tend to have great power later on. The earlier you get the item, the later in the game it will be used. The longer the span of time between acquisition and use, the more powerful the item is.\nWay To Go, Serge - It will eventually turn out that, for a minimum of the first sixty percent of the game, you were actually being manipulated by the forces of evil into doing their sinister bidding for them. In extreme cases this may go as high as 90%. The clear implication is that it would have been better to not get involved in the first place.\nGilligan’s Prescription - Any character who has amnesia will be cured before the end of the game. They usually won’t like what they find out about themselves, though.\nLuke, I Am Your Tedious, Overused Plot Device (Lynx Rule) - If there is any chance whatsoever that major villain X could be the male lead’s father, then it will turn out that major villain X is the male lead’s father.\nWorld of Mild Inconvenience - The devastating plague, noxious gas, planet-obliterating meteor or other large-scale disaster that led to the death of millions will affect your party (and your party’s friends and family members) in no way whatsoever, save that a few party members may become lost and you can find them later.\nGolden Chocobo Principle - There will be at least one supremely ultimate improvement for your weapon or some way to make your trusted steed capable of going anywhere and doing anything, requiring hours and hours of hard work to acquire. Once you do achieve this, you will use it once, and it will be completely useless for the rest of the game.\nGolden Chocobo Corollary - The magic formula for acquiring this supreme upgrade will be only vaguely alluded to in the game itself. Ideally, you’re supposed to shell out $19.95 for the strategy guide instead.\nFlow of Goods Rule - The quality of goods in the world is dependent upon the shop’s distance from the final dungeon. It doesn’t matter if the town you start in has a huge thriving economy and is the center of world trade, it will always have the game’s worst equipment; and even if that village near the end is isolated and has only three people in it, it will have the game’s best equipment.\nMaster Key Rule - Any and all locked doors that the characters encounter will be unlocked by the end of the game.\n“Evil will always triumph, because Good is dumb!” - If the villain needs all ten legendary medallions to attain world domination and you have nine of them, everybody in your party still thinks it is necessary to bring the nine to the villain’s castle and get the final one, instead of hiding the ones they’ve already got and spoiling his plans that way. After you foolishly bring the legendary medallions to the villain’s hideout, he will kidnap one of your companions (usually the main love interest) and you will trade the world away to rescue your friend.\nDark Helmet’s Corollary - After you give up the medallions to save your friend/parent/lover/other miscellaneous party member, don’t expect to actually get that person back. Sucker!\nIt’s Not My Department, Says Wernher Von Braun - All space stations, flying cities, floating continents and so forth will without exception either be blown up or crash violently to earth before the end of the game.\nThe Best-Laid Schemes - The final villain’s grand scheme will have involved the deaths of thousands or even millions of innocent people, the clever manipulation of governments, armies, and entire populations, and will have taken anywhere from five to five thousand years to come to fruition. The hero will come up with a method of undoing this plan forever in less than five minutes.\nPyrrhic Victory - By the time you’ve gotten it in gear, dealt with your miscellaneous personal crises and are finally ready to go Save the World once and for all, nine-tenths of it will already have been destroyed. Still, you’ve got to give your all to save the remaining one-tenth.\nPoetic Villain Principle (Kefka Rule) - All villains will suddenly become poets, philisophers, and/or dramatic actors when a) they first meet the hero, b) they are about to win or their evil plan is finally ready, c) some major event in the game is about to begin, d) right before the final battle, and e) right before they die, when they will frequently be feeling generous enough to reward you with some homespun wisdom about making the most of life while you have it.\nCompression of Time - As you approach the final confrontation with the villain, events will become increasingly awkward, contrived and disconnected from one another – almost as if some cosmic Author was running up against a deadline and had to slap together the ending at the last minute.\nAdam Smith’s Revenge - By the end of the game you are renowned everywhere as the Legendary Heroes, every surviving government and authority figure has rallied behind you, the fate of the world is obviously hanging in the balance, and out of nowhere random passers-by give you a pat on the back and heartfelt good luck wishes. However, shopkeepers won’t even give you a discount, much less free supplies for the final battle with evil.\nAdam Smith’s Corollary - No matter how thoroughly devastated the continent/planet/universe is, there’s always some shopkeeper who survived the end of the world and sits outside the gates of the villain’s castle, selling the most powerful equipment in the game, like nothing ever happened.\nThe Long Arm of the Plot - Any bad guys, no matter how far they run, will always end up in one of two ways by the end of the game: obviously dead, or on your side. There is no in-between.\nApocalypse Any Time Now - The best time to do side quests is while the huge meteor hovers in the sky above the planet, waiting to fall and destroy the world.\n“So, Andross, you reveal your true form!” - You will have to kill the evil villain at least twice at the end of the game. First the villain will look like a person or some creature and be rather easy to kill. Then he will grow to about 50 times the hero’s size and be much harder to kill.\nIn Your Face, Jesus! - Even if you manage to deal with him that time, you’re not done – the villain will then transform into his final form, which is always an angelic winged figure with background music remixed for ecstatic chorus and pipe organ.\nThe Moral Of The Story (Ghaleon Rule) - Every problem in the universe can be solved by finding the right long-haired prettyboy and beating the crap out of him.\nWeapon Rule - There’s always a hidden creature who is much harder to defeat than even the ultimate bad guy’s final, world-annihilating form. It’s lucky for all concerned that this hidden creature prefers to stay hidden rather than trying to take over the world himself, because he’d probably win. As a corollary, whatever reward you get for killing the hidden creature is basically worthless because by the time you’re powerful enough to defeat him, you don’t need it any more.\nThe Ultimate Rule - Anything called “Ultima (whatever)” or “Ultimate (whatever)” isn’t. There’s always at least one thing somewhere in the world which is even more.\nKnow Your Audience (Vyse Rule) - Every woman in the game will find the male lead incredibly attractive."

    "text": "⚖️ Government\n\nPolitics & Diplomacy\nPolitics and diplomacy become important in any fantasy, sci-fi or other fictional world where there are separate territories.\n\nWhat kinds of political systems exist in this world?\nWhat unique laws or political customs shape public and private life in this world?\nWho are the primary figures who influence (or manipulate) public opinion?\nWho are behind-the-scenes figures in politics who have influence the average Joe might not know about?\nWhere are the centers of power or law (and why are they located here)?\nWhere do key political negotiations, summits, meetings take place?\nWhen did the current political dispensation take power?\nWhen will leadership change (if ever) in this world, and why?\nWhy do alliances form or sever in this world?\nWhy do people in this world support (or rebel against) its political structures?\n\n\n\nRule of the Many\n\nDemocracy – Rule by the People– “The will of the majority”\n\nA form of government in which power is vested in the people. In larger nations, this is through freely elected representatives, although some forms of “direct” democracy exist in smaller form (majority rule), where people vote directly on legislation as a single body. There are various ways to go about a democracy, depending on the size of the group of people, the people representing themselves, and how their power is expressed.\nREAL: Most of the Western Hemisphere, Ancient Greece, Switzerland (direct)\nFICTION: The Free Cities (Game of Thrones), United Earth (Star Trek)\n\nRepublic – Rule by Representatives– “A balance of power”\n\nRepublics are ruled by elected individuals, whose duty is to represent the needs of their citizens, and exercise power on behalf of the people, according to the law of the land. Often times, these representatives are part of a house, parliament, or divided structure with multiple elected leaders. The kinds of republics often depend on how much power the representatives have vs. the public, and how those representatives are divided.\nREAL: Roman Republic, Free Imperial Cities (Holy Roman Empire), USA, UK, France, Germany\nFICTION: Galactic Republic (Star Wars), Adro (Powder Mage Trilogy)\n\nDemocratic Republic – Rule for the People – “Liberty for all”\n\nA familiar cross-section between “democracy” and “republic”. A representative democracy which people elect the representatives, and the representatives have the power to exercise the enacting of legislation. Here, you see a balance of power where “majority rule” is offset by the representation of the minority, in order to allow all groups of people to have power. (Incidentally, many countries in the real world use this term, while being undemocratic or authoritarian.)\nREAL: United States of America, Germany, South Korea, Ethiopia, Taiwan\nFICTION: City of Elendel (Alloy of Law: Mistborn Era 2), Baldurs Gate (Forgotten Realms)\n\nFederation/Confederation – Rule of the States– “Many as one, together or apart.”\n\nA group of several states which are members within a larger union, which decide on legislation for the broader entity. In a federation, the central authority is a federal government which holds the overall authority, where the states are subordinate to it. This allows overall control over diplomatic, economic, military, and legal issues.\n\nREAL: Germany, USA, Russia\nFICTION: United Federation of Planets (Star Trek)\n\nIn a confederation, the federal government is weaker and accountable to the member states, who are the true authority. These states can negotiate on joint foreign policy, and defensive matters. However, the rest is up to the states individually.\n\nREAL: CSA, Confederation of the Rhine\nFICTION: Terran Confederacy (Starcraft)\n\n\n\n\n\nRule of the Few\n\nOligarchy – Rule by the Few – “Will of the minority”\n\nConsidered an umbrella term for a society with a few, self-appointed rulers, dominating over a significantly larger body of citizens. This comes in a wide variety of forms, depending on what group is considered the ruling class. Throughout history, class systems gave way to prejudice of those of lower class, and privilege amongst those of higher status. In rare situations, this system was preferred over a single autocratic ruler. In most cases, however, this recognized rights only for the few, and authoritarian rule over the many.\n\nREAL: England (Magna Carta, 1215), Russian Empire, Iran, Saudi Arabia\nFICTION: Waterdeep/Masked Lords (Forgotten Realms)\n\n\nAristocracy – Rule by Heirs – “Let them eat cake”\n\nReferring to nobility, this government puts power in the hands of a small, privileged few who inherit their status from birth. Often time, this is not as a system of government itself, but as a mingling of the highest classes in a society which often includes the rich, powerful, and ruling class. A society where those of high birth have significant rights and privileges over the “unwashed” masses.\n\nREAL: Saudi Arabia, French Nobility (pre-1790), Russian Nobility, English Nobility\nFICTION: The Houses of Game of Thrones\n\n\nTheocracy – Rule by Religion – “Alpha and Omega”\n\nA government ruled by divine guidance, or individuals who are divinely guided. Often times, leaders are members of a clergy, priesthood, or religious sect. This can come in many forms: the state and religion are one entity, the leader(s) are chosen by a god (or are considered gods), laws are enforced based upon scripture and sacred traditions, mandating of divine or occult worship, etc. The masses must worship to the decree of the clergy-class, and non-believers are of the lowest class, often persecuted.\n\nREAL: Ancient Egypt, Byzantine Empire, Holy See (Vatican), Calphates, Shang Dynasty\nFICTION: Dune (Dune), Magisterium (His Dark Materials), Air Nomads (Avatar: the Last Airbender), Jedi Council (Star Wars), The Covenant (Halo Series)\n\n\nPlutocracy – Rule by the Rich – “Greed is good”\n\nA society which is ruled or controlled by those of great wealth or income. This can be conducted as direct rule, by dominating influence over rulers by way of economic power, or by consolidating wealth and using it to control markets directly. Elites come to power through unshared rapid economic growth, or through hoarding diminishing resources and wealth. To remain in power, shifts in trade and economics are played to the plutarchs advantage.\n\nREAL: USA (Gilded Age, Today), Merchant Republics (Venice, Florence), Carthage, Kingdom of France (pre-revolution)\n\nFICTION: Panem (The Hunger Games)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule of Authority\n\nAbsolute Monarchy – Rule of Royalty – “Divine right of kings”\n\nThe age-old, royal legacy of the monarch ruling class. Perhaps the most common form of autocracy in history, and especially the “fantasy” genre. Considered the “traditional” form of monarchy, the anointed sovereign holds supreme authority, not restricted by written laws or customs. These rulers possess “divine right” to enact their rule how they see fit. More often than not, succession is hereditary, centered on a house or family line. Kings/Queens are tended to by their subjects with servitude, and their reign is considered the will of God.\n\nREAL: Ancient Egypt (Pharaohs), House of Habsburg, France (Louis XIV), England (Charles I)\nFICTION: Robert/Joffrey Baratheon (Game of Thrones), Aragorn (Lord of the Rings)\n\n\nConstitutional Monarchy – Limited Rule of Royalty – “For King and Country”\n\nAs ages passed, and the enlightenment approached, revolutions demanded a limit to the power of kings. Unlike an absolute monarchy, the monarchs authority is derived from, or legally bound, by a constitution or legislature. This rule is executive in power, but may be counterbalanced with a parliament or council of other leaders. Sometimes, this is symbolic only. This can be hereditary, or an elected position.\n\nREAL: United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Japan\nFICTION: Breland (Ebberon), Queen Amidala (Star Wars)\n\n\nFascism – Rule by Dictatorship – “Might is Right”\n\nA form of authoritarian government characterized by extreme national identity and forcible oppression of opposition. This system is ruled by a dictator of whom is the premiere image of national pride. Opposition accounts for groups of people who do not fit the national (or ethnic) identity, and foreigners of any sort. This is often enforced by militaristic, strong-man attitudes, and considering a certain people “superior” either in nation, culture, or ethnicity.\n\nREAL: Nazi Germany, Axis Italy, Saddam’s Iraq\nFICTION: Norsefire Party (V for Vendetta), Pacific States of America (The Man in the High Castle), Terran Federation (Starship Troopers)\n\n\nEmpire – Rule by Expansion– “The Sun Never Sets”\n\nAn extensive group of states, countries, and territories under a single supreme authority. This government is characterized by expansionism, the conquering of lands, establishing of colonies, and ruling over peoples of various cultures. In earlier times, this expanse was ruled by a single individual (emperor, empress, czar, tsar), but eventually the definition changed to include colonial empires in which the host nation itself was the authority.\n\nREAL: Roman Empire, British Empire, Ottoman Empire, Qing Dynasty, Umayyad Caliphate, Aztec Empire\nFICTION: The Imperium (Warhammer 40k), Fire Nation (Avatar: The Last Airbender), Galactic Empire (Star Wars), Broddring Empire (Eragon: Inheritance Cycle)\n\n\nAutocracy – Rule by Only One – “I am Ozymandias, King of Kings.”\n\nA system of government ruled by one with absolute power. This can be a single person, or party. Decisions of this entity are not subject to legal constraints or popular control of any sort. Leaders are treated with fear, grandeur, and imagery of supreme power. With this said, most still require a power structure to rule, including military, nobles, and other elite groups. Succession is most often hereditary, or through conquering or revolt.\n\nREAL: Roman Empire (Augustus Caesar), England (King John), Imperial Russia (Tsar), French Empire (Napoleon)\nFICTION: Emperor Palpatine (Star Wars), The White Witch (Chronicles of Narnia), The Governor (The Walking Dead)\n\n\nTotalitarian – Limitless Rule – “Big brother is watching.”\n\nA political system which recognizes no limits in its authority, and strives to rule every aspect of the public and private life of its citizens. This can be under the power of a single person, faction or class. This is an extensive and pervasive method of rule usually guided by ideology, as the totality of the authority and the ideology can not be questioned. Enforcing such a realm requires near constant surveillance and control. Extreme authoritarianism.\n\nREAL: USSR, Nazi Germany, North Korea\nFICTION: Oceania (1984), World State (Brave New World)\n\n\n\n\n\nRevolutionary / Contested Rule\n\nCommunism – Rule for Redistribution– “Seize the means of production.”\n\nA socio-economic system where all property is communally owned. Each citizen receives a share of the resources based upon their needs. This emerges as a revolutionary ideology, and becomes the basis of a governments economic policy. Communism is not explicit to a type of rule. Ideologically, it strives to be a “state-less” system. However, historically, this system has been accompanied by governments with a single-party autocracy.\n\nREAL: USSR, China, North Korea\nFICTION: Thu (The Dispossessed), Arstotska (Papers, Please), Eurasia (1984)\n\n\nAnarchy – Struggle against Rule – “Down with the system.”\n\nIn most definitions, anarchy is a state of disorder due to the absence or nonrecognition of authority. However, anarchy is also a movement of liberation or revolt against a government or set hierarchy, rather than just a destination ideology. Anarchists exist in settings where centralized forms of government rule in contrast, where citizen unrest is growing and intensifying.\n\nREAL: Revolutionary Catalonia, Free Territory (Ukraine 1918), Democratic Federation of Northern Syria\nFICTION: V (V for Vendetta), Survivorism (Mistborn Series), Rocky Mountain States (The Man in the High Castle)\n\n\nMilitary Coup / Junta – Rule by Overthrow – “I am the revolution”\n\nTypically, when an uprising or coup occurs, the victor party becomes its own provisional government. Unlike a stratocracy, this rule is historically short-lived and the legitimacy of the new rulers is in a contested state. The formation of a proceeding government is necessary, but is pending organization, infrastructure, or the end of hostilities. The coup is often violent, but can be peaceful, such as part of a civil emergency.\n\nREAL: Spain (Napoleonic Wars), German Empire (mid-WWI), Various declarations of Martial Law\nFICTION: StateSec (Honor Harrington Series), Aslon (Legend of Asahiel Series)\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional Forms\n\nFeudalism – Rule of Lords and Kings– “All according to their station”\n\nA social system in which the nobility hold land from a king in exchange for military service. Down the chain, commoners (peasants/serfs) lived on their lord’s land in service to them. Peasants were provided military protection, and obligated to perform labor, provide a share of the produce, and pay homage. This relationship between lord and peasant is also referred to as Manorialism. In short, society was structured around the holding of land in exchange for service and labor. During the enlightenment, this way of living came into challenge by revolutions and evolving political theory. At the same time, many critics suggest that the economic system of today still shares similarity to feudalism. Most medieval fantasy fiction sets place in a vaguely feudal society, but some are more historically accurate than others.\n\nREAL: Medieval Europe, Asia, and the Middle East\nFICTION: Westeros (Game of Thrones), Nottingham (Robin Hood), Feredlen (Dragon Age: Origins)\n\n\nKritarchy – Rule by Judgement– “We are the law”\n\nA form of government dependent on judges. This is a traditional system based on customary law, rather that statutory law. This means rather relying on independent written laws, the law is passed by oral tradition, and open to the interpretation. While a majority of citizens might broadly agree on those laws, it is up to the judges to rule upon those laws. This grants a broad sense of freedom since there are no concrete statutes to follow (like taxation). However, depending on the customs, the law may still require obligations from its citizens. Also, judges may be considered the ruling class, absent of any judgement upon themselves, or may not be any different from citizens, adhering to the same laws.\n\nREAL: Somalia, Ancient Israel (Old Testament), Ancient Ireland (Druids), Frisia\nFICTION: Mega-City One (Judge Dredd)\n\n\nTribalism – Rule by Small Groups – “Birds of a feather”\n\nA state, or lifestyle organized into tribes, clans, or small groups of individuals within a closed network, often sharing a cultural identity. Loyalty to the social group is key to membership, and its customs dictate the rules of the tribe. Tribes may function as small governments within a larger one, or within an environment away from government, either as part of a hermitage or coven of privacy. Tribes may also refer to the conformity between groups of people. This “way of being” may refer to those of similar occupations or habits. However, any closed circle in tribalism means limited contact with the outside, resulting in limited education and understanding of the broader world.\n\nREAL: Tribes of Israel, Souix, Cherokee, Bedouin, Masai, Ainus, Zulu\nFICTION: The Wildlings (Game of Thrones), Dúnedain Rangers (Lord of the Rings), Southern Water Tribe (Avatar: The Last Airbender)\n\n\nTimocracy – Rule of the Honorable– “Veni, vedi, vici”\n\nThis is a war-like and honor-bound society where only those who possess land may participate in the government, and the ambition for honor, power, and military glory motivates the rulers. Civic honor and political power increases with the amount of property one owns. It is an oligarchy which is not strictly defined by the “inheritance” of an aristocracy, or the “absolute wealth” of a plutocracy (although often times, can become one of these two forms). You may imagine a society which is run by “houses”, regardless of whether they are noble, gained by wealth, or obtained deeds of “honor”, such as efforts in a military campaign. All other citizens are laborers, and exempt from making decisions. Intellectuals are discouraged from office, as the love for honor is greater than reason. It prefers simpler characters with plenty of spirit, better suited for war than peace.\n\nREAL: Sparta, Athens, Chivalry of the Middle Ages, Samurai\nFICTION: Klingons (Star Trek), Nords (The Elder Scrolls)\n\n\nGerontocracy – Rule of the Old – “The Elders are Watching”\n\nA system where society is ruled by the elders, or eldest. Some forms are habitual, meaning that it’s leaders tend towards the elder age group, while others are mandated, requiring a minimum age to qualify. It is common to find gerontocracies in cultures that value experience and wisdom as paramount, such as in theocracies. While traditional, it can take a more modern or futuristic spin. A system that generally honors the old over the new can fit this bill. This form can be seen throughout history, but in fiction, can also exist in dystopian societies where lifespans are increased for the few, and kept short for the many. The most extreme fictional example might see immortals as the few, and mortals as the many.\n\nREAL: Sparta (The Gerousia), The Vatican, Saudi Arabia, Roman Senate\nFICTION: Various Vampire Novels, Capitol (The Worthing Saga)\n\n\nDiarchy / Triumvirate – Rule by Two or Three – “Together, we shall rule”\n\nA diarchy is a government characterized by “co-rule” between two individuals of equal or competing power. Rulers can either be of the same status (two kings, queens), or be of separate rank where their powers are separated (king and a religious leader). A lawful diarchy may hold this system as a tradition that survives through generations, and relies solely on mutual co-operation. However, a “de facto” diarchy might mean that both rulers are actively contesting each-other for supreme rule. A government ruled by three entities is referred to as a Triumvirate. While less common than a diarchy, the separation of powers allow for more executive decision-making within a consolidated power structure.\n\nREAL: Roman Republic (Two Consuls, First Triumvirate), Japan (Shogunate), British India, Andorra,\nFICTION: King + High Sparrow (Game of Thrones), Ynnead (Warhammer), Darth Vader + Emperor (Star Wars),\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Traditional Forms\n\nSocialism – Rule for Public, not Private – “Redistribution of wealth”\n\nNot a government itself, but a set of policies aimed towards the redistribution of resources to the public, as opposed to private individuals. This often comes as a response to societies which wealth and privilege is tilted too far toward a single group of people, and promotes the flow of resources to the broader populace. The spectrum of leftist formats vary, but they all share an opposition against imperialist power structures and economics, and a support of collectivism. Socialist and leftist societies are most likely to be seen in sci-fi, since fantasy is often rife with feudal, imperial, or oligarchical governments that are pre-industrial.\n\nREAL: Takes various forms, ranging from democratic (Denmark, Norway) to libertarian (Anarcho-Syndicalist movement), and authoritarian (China, USSR).\nFICTION: KSR’s Mars Trilogy, The Star Fraction\n\n\nTechnocracy – Rule by the Skilled – “The Machine of Society”\n\nA government which elevates the talented, skilled, and intelligent into positions of authority. It idealizes the state as a machine, and professes that scientists, engineers, and the highly educated are best to rule, while the rest remained as workers in a class characterized by job specialization and rationed resources. A technocratic society is one that advocates for scientific method over superstition or religion. These states are referred to as “technates”. These experts are often appointed, rather than elected.\n\nREAL: Singapore, USSR (Leonid Brezhnev), Movement in the US during the Great Depression (1930’s)\nFICTION: The Institute (Fallout 4)\n\n\nCyberocracy – Rule by AI – “My Logic is Undeniable”\n\nA government that rules by the effective use of information. This system is centered on a complex method of communication (such as inter-connected computer networks) that directly pairs problems with their solvers. The purpose is to address the flaws of “bureaucracy” altogether, which can be a source of corruption, inefficiency, and small power struggles that detract from the solving of problems. Human beings making the decisions create countless inefficiencies which an super-intelligent network, or A.I. system can excel at.This automated form of government is theoretical, as there have been no actual cyberocracies to date. However, such a system could open the door to new forms of democracy, oligarchy, or authoritariansim. This can assist human progress, or hinder it. The risk of a “rogue AI” or “singularity event” is also a factor.\n\nREAL: No governments to date.\nFICTION: Neuromancer, The Matrix, I,Robot, Skynet (Terminator), Portal\n\n\nStratocracy – Rule by the Enlisted – “We Few, We Band of Brothers/Sisters”\n\nA government ran by chiefs of the military, centered on jurisdictional legalism, carried out by enlisted officers. Unlike a military dictatorship or junta, this is a stable government with full administrative, judicial, and legislative processes. All of these are supported by the law, constitution, and the society as a whole. Interestingly, this system does not necessarily need to be autocratic or oligarchic. However, it is centered on military service as a precursor to citizenship, and that citizenship is required to elect or govern.\n\nREAL: Myanmar (1997-2011), Roman Empire (Punic Wars), Ancient Sparta, The Cossacks\nFICTION: Cardassian Union (Star Trek), Galactic Empire (Star Wars), Terran Federation (Starship Troopers), Amestris (Fullmetal Alchemist), Earth Nation (Avatar, the Last Airbender)\n\n\nGeniocracy – Rule by the Intelligent – “Knowledge is power, literally.”\n\nThis government places the very intelligent at the top of the ruling class. Among these would be scientists, sociologists, and geniuses of high IP (Intellectual Potential), regardless of race or social class. Mandated tests would be taken to ascertain the IP of the populace, placing the top 20% as the electorate, and the top 0.5% as the electable. The mission of such a society is focused on a one-world government, eradicating violence, emphasizing fulfillment of the genii, and saving humanity from itself. However, while addressing the challenge of intelligence and a basis of scientific thinking, it values raw intelligence over practical-use intelligence, and also does not address ethics in scientific progress or leadership, which could result in IP-driven classism, persecution, or even eugenics.\n\nREAL: No government, but high-IQ organizations like Mensa International do exist.\nFICTION: World State (Brave New World)\n\n\nNoocracy – Rule by the Mind – “Infinity, ahead and behind.”\n\nA social or political system ruled by an “aristocracy of the wise”, a caste of philosopher kings. This society heralds shared wisdom, based on the priority of human mind. This differs from a geniocracy by not valuing raw intelligence, but the practical and political intelligence to steer humanity through the turbulent waters of the future and into a new golden age. However, this thinking is directly opposed to democracy, which is considered a system of irrational (and emotional) consensus. Instead, it presumes citizens to not have the knowledge necessary to achieve their aims, and otherwise do not know any better. No elected politicians. Its best to let the wizened experts assume control. This idea is seen in science fiction more than fantasy. This idea can take multiple forms, such as a non-fundamentalist theocracy, a technocracy that emphasizes experience and awareness over talent, a collective of mind-linked brains, or an extra-terrestrial entity whose mission is to guide humanity.\n\nREAL: Purely theoretical.\nFICTION: The Traveler (Destiny Series), Helios (Deus Ex)\n\n\nDemarchy – Rule by Lottery – “Pick a card. Any card.”\n\nAlso referred to as “Sortition”, this is a unique kind of democracy which is based on random lottery. Not everyone has power, but everyone is eligible to be selected. In some variations, this is administered as a direct democracy, taking random poll from a populace. In others, it is less democratic, the eligible belonging to a specific class or status, or are gathered to vote representatives rather than engage in direct policy making. This form has been preferred in situations when only a small voting body is needed, and there is intense desire to combat aristocracy, or avoid corruption, favoritism, or bribery. However, being that it is random, there is a chance as always to either have less than desirable effects, or it be used to obscure bribery or corruption further by “adjusting” the chance of a certain group being picked.\n\nREAL: Legal systems, and law court juries (Jury Duty), Italian City States (Great Councils)\nFICTION: The Demarchy (Revelation Space), Thalassa (Songs of Distant Earth), Martian Lower House (Blue Mars)\n\n\nMagocracy – Rule by Mages– “Expelliarmus“\n\nAn oligarchical organization ruled by the most prominent of mages and spell-casters. This society holds those of magical ability as higher birth and higher privilege, either alongside other aristocracy, or over the mundane altogether. In some cases, only those who can wield magic have a voice in government. One is most likely to see a magocracy at work alongside academies, magical schools, or societies which are ruled by powerful wizards. The society may rely on the type of magic which is most prominent. Mastery in divine magic may be treated similar to a theocracy, where arcane prowess might see parallels to a geniocracy. Mundane citizens may be lowly regarded or persecuted. Naturally, this is a fantastical sort of government, so no real-world examples exist.\n\nFICTION: Ministry of Magic (Harry Potter), Tevinter Imperium (Dragon Age), Merilon (Darksword Trilogy)\n\n\n\n\n\nDecadent Forms\n\nDespotism / Tyrrany – Rule by Cruelty – “Crush your enemies.”\n\nTypically characterizing the crueler nature of a authoritarian government, a tyranny is a state that oppresses its citizens. This can be by depriving freedoms, opportunities, welfare, resources, or things essential to life and prosperity. This can also include acts of violence, destruction, or torture. Despotism refers to governments ruled by a single supreme entity, often known for their brutality and cruelty. This entity is most often a person, but can depict a group, party, faction, organization that flexes their power with disregard to human life. You may often see tyrannical regimes or despotic rulers target or neglect a people, or groups of people within their realm.\n\nREAL: Nazi Germany (Hitler), Roman Empire (Caligula), Oliver Cromwell, Ivan the Terrible, Vlad the Impaler\nFICTION: Lord Ruler (Mistborn: The Final Empire), Sauron (Lord of the Rings), Thanos (Marvel Comics)\n\n\nKleptocracy – Rule of Thieves – “Two for me, none for you.”\n\nA system that is either ruled by thieves, or is stooped in (or encourages) thievery. Conspiracy, theft, and corruption is at the epicenter of government, and its victors are those who overcome the banditry and scheming come out on top. Naturally, depending on whether the environment is within a known den of thievery, or amongst the daylight, thieves may or may not admit to such a thing, so it is rare to see a “Kleptocracy” out in the open. Secrecy and information is of the highest of value to an individuals prosperity and survival. Coin in the right hands, words in the right ear, and a knife in the right pocket can be the difference between life and death. This term is also thrown around as a way to describe a system overwhelmed with corruption, which would function as any other government if it wasn’t for the overwhelming incentive to lie, cheat, and steal.\n\nREAL: Gangs, guilds, and pirates. Otherwise, no state willingly calls itself a Kleptocracy.\nFICTION: Tortuga (Pirates of the Caribbean)\n\n\nFragile State – Rule Coming Undone– “My kingdom for a horse.”\n\nA failed state (or fragile state) is defined as one that has disintegrated to the point where the basic conditions and responsibilities of a government no longer function properly. Various metrics are used to judge whether a state is failing, fragile, or failed. The following are signs of a failing state:\n\nLoss of legitimate authority to make unified decisions\nLoss of control of territory, or recognition of sovereignty\nInability to provide public services or enforce laws\nInability to interact as a full member of the international community.\nDecline of human rights, economy, security, public health, and sovereignty\n\nWhen in this position, either the state that was will fracture, will devolve into mob rule, will be susceptible to foreign influence or conquering, or will over time and through suffering transition into a system that allows it recover. Recovery requires state development, which can come from either nation-building, war-making, or foreign aid.\n\nREAL: Western Roman Empire, Mayan Civilization, French Monarchy (pre-revolution), Weimar Republic (1930s), East Germany (Cold War), Late USSR, Yugoslavia\nFICTION: Kings Landing/Mad King (Game of Thrones), Adro Monarchy (Powder Mage Trilogy)\n\n\nCyclical Bureaucracy – Rule by Paperwork – “Let me check with my superior.”\n\nA satirical sort of government that I invented one rainy day in my high school years. Inspired by the goblins of Harry Potter, and the Vogons of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, the idea of a massive bureaucracy consisting of 3000+ members where all acts of rule require the proper form. All forms are drafted, and then must be approved by the drafters superior. The superior must review and submit it to their superior. Forms eventually round the entire hierarchy of superiors until it reaches the last person, of whom the original drafter is the superior of. The cycle continues forever, until the timeline for submitting expires, or the conditions for Special Provision X is reached."

    "text": "🗺️ Geography\nWhen you are mapping, you can put all sorts of things on the map. Obviously, you will be drawing how the main land mass looks, as well as the water around it. Aside from that, however, here are some ideas for what you can add to your map:\n\nBorders marking out where the countries are. If you’re really into it, and the countries are large, you can even add states.\nMajor cities are important too, especially the capitals of countries.\nIn addition to the ocean, you can have other sources of water such as rivers and lakes. When you’re making cities, the biggest cities are usually closest to a source of water. Sources of water can come from aquifers, too, which are underground, but the oldest cities tended to form around rivers or lakes. Water is important.\nMap what the land looks like. Mountains, prairies, deserts, hills, plateaus, marshes, coasts, volcanic regions, tundra, etc.\nMajor landmarks, tourist attractions, historic sites, religious sites, or monuments.\nRailroads, roads, or other routes of travel between cities (depending on the technological level of your society).\n\n\n🌦️Climate\n\nThe poles of a planet, which are furthest away from the sun, will generally have the coldest weather. And in contrast, areas near the equator will be the warmest.\nClimate is a gradient. Unless you have something weird and supernatural going on, a very hot desert is not likely to border a snowy tundra region. Climate changes gradually as you travel the planet. There are no drastic lines where different climates cut off.\nAreas near the coasts of oceans tend to be milder, with less extreme temperature differences (the UK generally has pretty mild, rainy weather, since nearly all its land is within a short distance of the ocean compared to a larger country like America). Areas toward the middle of the continent away from the coast tend to have more extreme temperatures (the Midwest US, for instance, has very hot summers and very cold winters).\nSeasons are important too. You can go with the standard four seasons we observe today, or you can have rainy and dry seasons as well. Alternatively, you can make up your own seasons. Just make sure they make sense.\n\n\n\n🛢️ Natural Resources\nNatural resources, from water and air to minerals, plants, wildlife and metals, are essential to varying degrees for survival. Your world may have different essentials to our own, of course (maybe you have an alien race that can synthesize its chemical needs some other way).\n\nWhat is the most precious or in demand natural resource, and why?\nWhat natural resources are most endangered or at risk, and what could/must be done to avoid disaster?\nWho has the monopoly on each natural resource (or are resources more universally shared or hard to find)? Why?\nWho uses the most natural resources (individually or as a group such as a nation, city, government). Are some fair or wise in their use while others are selfish or unaware?\nWhere is each natural resource located? How has this impacted other categories of worldbuilding such as trade, geography, transportation, environment?\nWhere are the most strategic locations for access to natural resources? Is there (or has there been) conflict over who controls them?\nWhen was each natural resource discovered, have some been used longer than others in different regions?\nWhen will supplies of resources dwindle? Will they be abundant for the span of your characters’ lives?\nWhy is access to natural resources either constrained/controlled or free?\nWhy are natural resources important to social justice or politics?"

    "section": "🔫 Military & Police",
    "text": "🔫 Military & Police\n\nUnderstanding the Period\n\nThe first and most important aspect of building a military is to understand the warfare of the period your world is set in. Whether it be iron age or space age, you should have a fundamental understanding of how warfare was (or will be) fought. That doesn’t mean that you have to replicate everything from history or can’t create your own weapons, systems of warfare, and integrate things like magic to create new types of warfare. And, of course, futuristic settings have a lot less to go off of then historical settings. Even then, it is important to think about how the technology impacts warfare. In an age with super advanced robots, why would humans still be fighting? These are questions you have to consider. Things like tactics, formations, orders of battle, etc. are all really important. For example, in ancient warfare, a lot of battles began with missile exchanges that could last for hours. Battles weren’t these huge bloodfests, there were lots of gaps and breaks. Armies rarely lost more than 10% of their fighting force. And pitched battles were relatively rare; most warfare was skirmishing, positioning, and sieging.\n\nThe Military System - Next is seeing what military system you’d want to use. A system must make sense for the nation. You can’t expect a hunter-gatherer society to make use of a professional army. Examples include:\n\nCitizen Army- citizens generally equip themselves and are mustered in times of need. Notable examples are Ancient Greek City-States and the Roman Republic prior to the Marian Reforms.\nProfessional Army- soldiers are recruited, trained, and equipped by the state. Most modern armies are professional.\nTribal Army- warriors, either part of a warrior class or not, join up arms when necessary or when they feel like it. Local leaders have the greatest control in this system. ‘Barbarians’ tend to fall into this category.\nAutomaton Army- robots to do the battle. They can be commanded by biological beings or AI. Another example would be creatures like golems, risen by magic, or even armies like the undead as long as they don’t have their own personalities/control.\n\nFeudal Army- Vassals levy peasants and members of a warrior class (like knights) under them to serve their lords. Feudal Europe and Japan are the poster children for this.\nThe Purpose - What is a military’s purpose to its state? That seems like an obvious answer: to fight wars, duh. However, it’s actually more complicated than that. Some armies are more than just soldiers. They are police, emergency personnel, political enforcers, or other.\n\nA nation with a warrior army generally doesn’t control its warriors very well; the warriors often go on raids, fight each other, or otherwise. For example, vikings would bring back slaves and goods from all over, but you couldn’t really say that they were dispatched by their kingdoms for this tactically.\nThe earlier Roman armies were conquerors; expanding the state. The late Roman armies were protectors; guarding the empire from invasion. It’s important to know if your nation has a military geared towards offense or defense.\n\nNations with holy orders, such as the Teutonic Order, serve a religious purpose as well as a military one. In fantasy worlds, an army may just as well be adapted to hunting monsters or fending off the underworld as they are to fighting regular wars.\nTrading nations tend to have militaries that protect their trade interests. Anti-pirate navies and caravan guards are a priority."

    "section": "Scenes",
    "text": "Scenes\nFive Point Checklist:\n\nAn action (something concrete, not thinking)\nDialogue\n\nNot generic talk, but specific to narrative\nSpecific Intimate Details\n\nInner Point of View\n\nReact - doing something in the moment\nReflect - thinks about what they’re faced with and internally face their options\nReveal - reveals something to reader and how they’ll react\n\nDefinite stop and start point\n\nSnowflake Method to Write Scenes\n\nLarge-Scale Structure of a Scene\nA Scene has the following three-part pattern:\n\nGoal\n\nA Goal is what your POV character wants at the beginning of the Scene. The Goal must be specific and it must be clearly definable. The reason your POV character must have a Goal is that it makes your character proactive. Your character is not passively waiting for the universe to deal him Great Good. Your character is going after what he wants, just as your reader wishes he could do. It’s a simple fact that any character who wants something desperately is an interesting character. Even if he’s not nice, he’s interesting. And your reader will identify with him. That’s what you want as a writer.\n\nConflict\n\nConflict is the series of obstacles your POV character faces on the way to reaching his Goal. You must have Conflict in your Scene! If your POV character reaches his Goal with no Conflict, then the reader is bored. Your reader wants to struggle! No victory has any value if it comes too easy. So make your POV character struggle and your reader will live out that struggle too.\n\nDisaster\n\nA Disaster is a failure to let your POV character reach his Goal. Don’t give him the Goal! Winning is boring! When a Scene ends in victory, your reader feels no reason to turn the page. If things are going well, your reader might as well go to bed. No! Make something awful happen. Hang your POV character off a cliff and your reader will turn the page to see what happens next.\n\n\nA Sequel has the following three-part pattern:\n\nReaction\n\nA Reaction is the emotional follow-through to a Disaster. When something awful happens, you’re staggering for awhile, off-balance, out of kilter. You can’t help it. So show your POV character reacting viscerally to his Disaster. Show him hurting. Give your reader a chance to hurt with your characters. You may need to show some passage of time. This is not a time for action, it’s a time for re-action. A time to weep. But you can’t stagger around in pain forever. In real life, if people do that they lose their friends. In fiction, if you do it, you lose your readers. Eventually, your POV character needs to get a grip. To take stock. To look for options. And the problem is that there aren’t any…\n\nDilemma\n\nA Dilemma is a situation with no good options. If your Disaster was a real Disaster, there aren’t any good choices. Your POV character must have a real dilemma. This gives your reader a chance to worry, which is good. Your reader must be wondering what can possibly happen next. Let your POV character work through the choices. Let him sort things out. Eventually, let him come to the least-bad option…\n\nDecision\n\nA Decision is the act of making a choice among several options. This is important, because it lets your POV character become proactive again. People who never make decisions are boring people. They wait around for somebody else to decide. And nobody wants to read about somebody like that. So make your character decide, and make it a good decision. Make it one your reader can respect. Make it risky, but make it have a chance of working. Do that, and your reader will have to turn the page, because now your POV character has a new Goal.\n\n\n\n\nSmall-Scale Structure of a Scene\nWrite “Motivation-Reaction Units”, or MRUs. Alternate between Motivation and Reaction\n\nMotivation is external and objective (something your reader also sees)\nReaction is internal and subjective (character reaction to the motivation in following paragraph)\n\nFeeling\nReflex\nRational Action & Speech\n\n\n\n\nMicrotension\nTension in small moments, including:\n\nWhen a character has conflicting feelings\nCreated by the element of surprise\nA sudden change in emotion\nWhen things feel off\n\nHow to add microtension:\n\nDialogue - Examine each line of dialogue. Take out boring and unnecessary words and trivial matters. Go for clever. Find a way to give each speaker a unique voice and style of speaking. Subtext can hint at what characters are really feeling below the surface, and that creates mystery. Keep in mind the tension is in the relationship between the characters speaking, not in the information presented.\nAction - This can be with any kind of action—high or low. Even a gesture is action. So think how to make an action incongruous. What does that mean? Real people are conflicted all the time. Real people are complex, inconsistent. So by having a character react in an incongruent manner, and having incongruent developments in the storyline, will add microtension. Have things happen and characters react in ways the reader does not expect. And, most important, show everything through the POV character’s emotions. Action will not be tense unless the character is experiencing it and emotionally reacting to it.\nExposition - Exposition is the prose, your writing. It is the way you explain what is happening as you show it. It includes internal monologue. Find ways to add those conflicted emotions and create dissonance. Show ideas at war with one another. Use word choices that feel contradictory. Find fresh, different ways to describe common things.\n\n\n\nList of Common Fantasy Scenes\n\n\n\nFantasy Scene Formats\n\nMagical Experiences\n\nSpellcasting or ritual\nFirst time magic use or awakening\nMagical duel\nCrafting or potion-making\nInteraction with magical creatures\n\nRealm and World Exploration\n\nJourney through mythical landscapes\nEntering magical city or hidden village\nExploring ancient ruins or temples\nPortal or dimensional gateway crossing\nNavigating enchanged forests or mazes\n\nConversations of Lore\n\nDiscussing prophecies or legends\nStorytelling or bardic performance\nElders imparting ancient wisdom or histories\nDebriefing with mentors or wise figures\nDeciphering ancient texts or runes\n\nEpic Battles and Skirmishes\n\nClan wars or tribal confrontations\nSiege or defense of fortress/castle\nMonster or dragon hunting/fighting\nRescue missions in enemy territory\n\nInteractions with Fantasy Races\n\nDiplomatic meetings with elves, dwarves, etc.\nIntimate moments in interspecies relationships\nTrading or bartering at fae markets\nMagical creature tournaments or races\nCultural exchanges or feasts with mythical races\n\nQuests and Adventures\n\nTreasure hunting in cursed tombs\nSeeking magical artifacts or relics\nPursuit of mythical beasts or guardians\nNavigating deadly magical traps\nUndercover missions in an enemy’s court\n\nSacred and Spiritual Moments\n\nCommuning with gods or celestial beings\nPilgrimages to sacred or enchanted sites\nUndergoing spiritual trials or visions\nReceiving blessings or curses at holy places\nJoining or witnessing magical cult ceremonies\n\nCourtly Intrigues and Politics\n\nRoyal balls or court gatherings with magical elements\nEspionage or spying in a mage’s tower\nAssassination attempts using magic\nPolitical debates in councils of mages or kings\nTournament of magical skills or jousting\n\nPersonal Fantasy Challenges\n\nTaming or bonding with magical beasts\nOvercoming curses or enchantments\nNavigating love triangles with magical beings\nTrials to become a knight, mage, or chosen one\nTraining under a magical mentor or in a wizarding school\n\nMystical Revelations and Twists\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFantasy Scene Types\n\nConversations/Dialogues\n\nTwo-person heart to heart\nGroup discussion or debate\nConfrontation or argument\nConfession or revelation\nInterview or interrogation\n\nAction Sequences\n\nFight or battle scene\nChase or pursuit scene\nEscape or evasion scene\nHeist or theft scene\nTraining or preparation scene\n\nDiscovery & Exploration\n\nInvestigation or clue-finding scene\nExploration or journey scene\nFlashback or memory exploration\nEureka or realization moment\nDream or vision sequence\n\nEmotional & Reflective Moments\n\nGrief or mourning scene\nLove or romantic scene\nBetrayal or disappointment scene\nTriumph or celebration scene\nSolitude or introspection scene\n\nAtmospheric & Setting Driven Scenes\n\nWorldbuilding or lore exploration\nFestival or cultural celebration\nTravel or montage scene\nLandscape or scenic description\nDaily life or routine scene\n\nTension and Suspense\n\nSneaking or stealth scene Trapped or confinement scene\nDilemma or decision-making scene\nAmbush or surprise attack scene\nTime-based challenge or countdown scene\n\nMystical and Supernatural\n\nRitual or magical ceremony\nHaunting or ghostly encounter\nDivine or spiritual revelation\nTransformation or shape-shifting scene\nPortal or transition to another realm\n\nSocial and Public Events\n\nParty or ballroom scene\nPublic execution or judgment\nSporting event or competition\nMarket or shopping scene\nCeremony or rite of passage\n\nPersonal Challenges and Triumphs\n\nOvercoming fears or personal demons\nMastery or levelling up scene\nSacrifice or selfless act\nResisting temptation or corruption\nHealing or recovery scene\n\nPlot Twists & Revelations\n\nUnmasking or identity reveal scene\nPlot twist or unexpected turn of events\nBackstab or betrayal reveal\nSecret or hidden agenda reveal\nProphecy or foretelling scene"

    "section": "Minimize Your Big Tech Data Presence",
    "text": "Minimize Your Big Tech Data Presence\nThis is admittedly difficult to do. And really the players to worry about within the big 5 are Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google (FYI: I don’t really know enough about Apple and its ecosystem to speak to those concerns):\n\nMeta - Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, Threads, Meta Quest, etc.\nAmazon - Amazon.com, Alexa, Kindle, Prime, Twitch, Ring, Goodreads, etc.\nGoogle - Android, Gmail, Chrome, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Maps, Fitbit, Pixel, YouTube, etc.\nMicrosoft - Windows OS, OneDrive, Edge, Outlook, Office, Copilot & Open AI, LinkedIn, GitHub, Skype, etc.\n\nHowever, big tech will bend the knee to authority when they deem it necessary - see this example with Microsoft in Gaza.\nHere are some of the things I have done to try and minimize this risk:\n\nUse Alternatives Whenever Possible\n\nStop using Chrome and Edge and use Firefox or Brave for a web browser\nStop using Outlook and Gmail outside of work and use a more secure email\nStop using Google Drive and OneDrive and use encrypted cloud storage\nStop using Audible & Kindle and use your local library to access books via Hoopla & Libby\n\nRun AI/LLMs on my local machine whenever possible. This is admittedly dependent on having a good PC to run models on, but the only queries I give to online chatbots are coding related, so anything remotely identifying I do not send to an online chatbot. Given that Open AI is currently exploring advertising as a revenue stream, it will only be a matter of time before these models are used to sell you crap you don’t need.\n\n\n\nDetermine If You Really Need It, And If Not, DO NOT USE / DELETE\n\nDelete social media accounts you won’t miss; if you don’t delete them outright, scrape them down into oblivion so any data previously on them can’t be used against you.\nCancel your Amazon Prime subscription. (Ideally, don’t shop on Amazon at all, but I understand this is difficult to do for some, and it’s not like substituting shopping Walmart+ is much better in the grand scheme of things. Shopping local is best if you can afford the additional cost.)\nDon’t use any DNA / Genetic Testing services. With the current lack of regulations, any results from these tests can and will be used against you for any insurance that’s not health insurance (and who knows if that’s guaranteed in the future anyways).\nDon’t use smart home devices. I don’t have a Nest thermostat, Google Home, Alexa, etc. If you must use a smart TV (it’s hard to find dumb TVs these days) turn off as many features as possible. I briefly used a smart watch but realized even that was giving too much of my data away to some random third-party.\n\nHere are some things I’m considering doing, but haven’t pulled the trigger on just yet:\n\nTransition away from Windows OS to use Linux distros\nDelete my Facebook account - I’m only keeping it for Marketplace and local updates for now.\nTransition away from Discord and instead communicate solely through secure means"
