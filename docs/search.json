    "text": "The Good of 2023\n\nMore Travel Goals Met\nI was able to travel quite a bit this year, including going to the following areas:\n\nWisconsin\nNational Parks near Las Vegas and Maine\nNew Orleans\n\nTo start off, here are the national parks I managed to visit. There was a few in July, including the Grand Canyon:\n\n\n\nGrand Canyon - Bright Angel Point\n\n\nBryce Canyon National Park:\n\n\n\nBryce Canyon - Queens/Navajo Combination Loop\n\n\nand Zion National Park:\n\n\n\nZion National Park - The Narrows\n\n\nAdditionally, I was able to hit Acadia in September:\n\n\n\nAcadia - Beehive Loop\n\n\nBesides national parks, I was also was able to go to New Orleans in December:\n\n\n\nNew Orleans - French Quarter\n\n\nOverall, I’ve knocked off even more places that were on my travel bucket list in 2023, and I’m looking forward to visiting some more places in 2024.\n\n\nFinding Peace in Doing Things Alone\nIn June, I was lucky enough to be able to take a solo trip for a work conference. This was the first time I had ever traveled across states without knowing a single person at the location I went to (I’ve traveled alone in airplanes, but usually friends/family awaited me at the airport).\nGetting a rental car and exploring an unfamiliar area solo was nerve-wracking, especially as there were a few anxiety-inducing situations that happened on the trip (getting attacked by birds, a deer almost running into me, and learning I get claustrophobic in caves). However, I’m glad I took advantage of the opportunity my workplace gave me and did the trip.\n\n\n\nMadison - Olbrich Botanical Gardens\n\n\nI tried to take that approach into other areas of my life, including solo hiking and attending local events by myself throughout the year. These were easier to do solo than a trip to another state, and I’m slowly getting better at putting myself out there at events where I don’t know another soul in attendance. I still don’t like it, but I am building confidence in the fact that I can indeed do it.\n\n\nA More Optimal Financial Setup\nThis isn’t a particularly “fun” topic, but I took another look at my financial setup and finally opened up a high-yield savings account to take advantage of high interest rates. This isn’t exactly a life-altering change, but it has resulted in me making more in interest on my liquid savings, and every little bit helps as I consider my future financial goals."

    "text": "The Bad of 2023\n\nLoneliness is Relentless\nUnfortunately I had a family member pass early in January from cancer, which really didn’t set a good tone for how 2023 was going to go. This led to some infighting amongst my extended family, which is never any fun to deal with.\nUltimately, the above was a wake-up call to a bitter truth that I needed to swallow. I grieved and accepted I won’t have the family relationships that I wish I did. I’m not like the rest of my family; for example, most of them were lucky to graduate high school, yet I obtained a Master’s degree. I recognize overall it’s not a bad thing to be different in this situation, but I won’t lie, it’s easy to feel envious of others who do have those relationships in their life.\nI also didn’t make any progress in building more meaningful relationships (romantic, platonic, or otherwise) in 2023. (This feels embarrassing to type out, as this has been a goal of mine for years now.) I know it wasn’t for a lack of effort, as I focused on local in-person events and Meetup groups for 2023. Unfortunately, they simply didn’t pan out as I hoped.\nI’m trying to approach this disappointment with radical acceptance, telling myself that “it is what it is” and that my self-worth is not defined by the quality and/or quantity of relationships I have currently in my life. I’m also trying to cut myself some slack; most people would struggle with loneliness if they had to spend effectively two years completely isolated due to COVID, WFH, and living in a new location.\n\n\nHealth Stressors\nIn the early months of 2023, I dealt with muscle twitching across my entire body. For a while I thought this was due to handling stress poorly, but I eventually was able to remedy the issue by upping my calcium intake (pro-tip for anyone who runs into this issue!), but when it happened near constantly for months on end prior, I was incredibly stressed out."

    "text": "The Good of 2021\n\nBuying a House and Moving Closer to Home\nIf you asked me a year ago if I would have bought a house and took on a mortgage, I wouldn’t have believed you. However, a silver lining of remote work is that data analytics jobs don’t necessarily need to be done in a specific location, so I was able to leverage that to buy a place that’s much closer to where my family is located.\nAlthough buying a house has more stressors associated with it than renting does, I will say I appreciate the increased space, peace and quiet, and lower cost of living I’ve been afforded being able to move out of a larger city.\n\n\nMaking My First Game\nAs I referenced in a previous post, I made my first game, Edge of Chaos! Now that I have the confidence and learnings of that experience, I look forward to making the game I’ve always dreamed of over the next few years.\n\n\nThe Vaccine Making Travel Safer\nI had opportunities to travel in 2021, especially with being able to get vaccinated all the way back in January.\nI was able to visit my family in Florida:\n\nVisit Frederick Meijer Garden (highly recommended):\n\n\n\nFrederick Meijer Garden - Cherry Blossoms\n\n\nSaw a sunset on Lake Michigan (at the insistence of my coworkers) on the longest day of the year, which given that Michigan is on the edge of Eastern Standard Time, happened at 10 PM:\n\n\n\nLake Michigan\n\n\nSee stunning landscapes in Sleeping Bear Dunes:\n\n\n\nSleeping Bear Dunes\n\n\nAnd go to Philadelphia for the first time whilst attending PAX Unplugged:\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia, City of Stop Beating Up The Giants So Badly Please\n\n\nOverall, my 2021 was WAY more active than 2020."

    "text": "The Bad of 2021\n\nMore COVID Troubles\nNew variants, continued strain on the healthcare system, the politicizing of basic protections against the disease, and burnout are but a few of the problems that we all faced in the continued marathon against COVID-19. Many hospital systems are overrun with the Omicron variant and due to global mismanagement of vaccines, new variants will inevitably crop up going into 2022.\nThe economic fallout of the pandemic also can’t be underestimated. Inflation is at 6.8% in November 2021, the highest it’s been in 40 years. (Due to inflation we are also seeing shrinkflation and skimpflation, so that number is probably underestimating its true impact.) To combat inflation, interest rates will have to rise, which may cause yet another stock market tumble/recession.\n\n\nMental Health Struggles\nLoneliness cropped up pretty hard on me for parts of 2021, making it hard to function at the level that I would like to. Being able to move near the end of the year made things easier, but for the majority of the year prior to the move, outside of the travel referenced above, I barely met up with anyone. The prolonged isolation has impacted my personality and way of coping with stress, though with being closer to home I won’t be nearly as isolated for 2022.\nWith the loneliness my desire to follow healthy habits has also taken a hit. One of my main goals for 2022 is to get in good physical shape again, since 2 years of WFH and emotional eating haven’t done my body any favors. (It’s not as bad as it could be, but I could really be doing better in this regard and need to make some changes sooner rather than later.)\n\n\nTransitions\nThere’s obviously the hassle of moving states that is a part of this transition. But there’s more change going on in my career as well. The relative stability of my job last year has been in flux, with 3 different managers in 1 year, changing departments, and having the way work is completed be done through a new process in SAFe. Many favorite coworkers of mine have left for greener pastures, which is always hard to watch.\nHowever, the anxiety from transitions should alleviate since I won’t have to worry about where I’m living for a while, what with buying a house and all. So this downside likely won’t appear to this extent in any future years of my life (or at least I hope not)."

    "text": "The Good of 2022\n\nCareer Promotion\nIn January I was promoted at my job and have appreciated the opportunity to work at a title with a higher seniority and all that comes with it. I’ve gotten some experience with managing people and projects in this last year as well, which should serve me well with respect to my future career goals.\n\n\nCreating a “Second Brain”\nThis year, I came across the concept of a Second Brain after reading a book on the topic by Tiago Forte. A Second Brain (in non-self-help) terms is basically an organized digital space where any ideas, thoughts, or other information you might want to look back on in the future are stored.\nI’ve used OneNote since I started my current role, becoming a huge fan of its search feature in particular to find old notes. But while I enjoyed OneNote, I still wasn’t using it to its fullest potential since I wasn’t keeping it well-organized. I’d throw notes in wherever and hope that the search function would help me find whatever I had written down.\nNow, I’m much more deliberate with the process. It took many hours to organize my OneNote but now it’s much easier to find where things are located. Further, since notes are now in more logical areas, I can connect concepts together that previously I might have entirely missed out on.\nI know it sounds weird that one of my big wins this year basically amounted to being more disciplined and organizing better, but something clicked with me this year to take digital organization seriously. I firmly believe this change will pay huge dividends long-term for my personal development.\n\n\nTravel\nThis year I had the opportunity to travel to some different locations I hadn’t been previously.\nThe highlight of the year’s trips was one that I took to Colorado in the summer, which included visiting a zany museum in Denver called Meow Wolf:\n\n\n\nMeow Wolf - Convergence Station\n\n\nVisiting Black Canyon National Park:\n\n\n\nBlack Canyon of the Gunnison National Park\n\n\nAnd Rocky Mountain National Park:\n\n\n\nRocky Mountain National Park\n\n\nIt was my first time being in a different time zone, a mile above sea level, visiting a US national park, and in a desert. Colorado knocked off a lot of “firsts” for me!\nI also saw a light show called LUMA:\n\n\n\nBinghamton LUMA\n\n\nAnd I visited Pittsburgh for the first time, seeing the skyline at night from the Duquesne Incline:\n\n\n\nPittsburgh - Duquesne Incline\n\n\nI’m grateful that I’ve been able to go so many places this year."

    "text": "The Bad of 2022\n\n(All The) Stressors\n2022 wasn’t as tranquil as I was hoping for after buying my house.\nMy personal life has experienced a fair bit of turbulence this year that I wasn’t anticipating. Family members have had their health deteriorate due to cancer on both sides, which has increased long-running tensions. Further, I had to reset my social life after moving, and that’s taken up a lot of my time and energy.\nProfessionally, my workplace (Spectrum) merged with another health system (Beaumont) and rebranded themselves as Corewell Health. There’s not been any direct changes yet to my role, but mergers inherently come with additional stress. Though there’s been no direct changes to my role since the promotion, I will have a new boss in early 2023 as Corewell hires a director to grow its data science capabilities. While there’s a great opportunity with that transition, there’s always uncertainty whenever your manager changes.\nThen there’s been the general stressors that are societal, such as the economy, climate change, politics, etc. I won’t go into detail on those here, but living in interesting times isn’t what I’d call relaxing by any means.\n\n\nMissed Goals\nI was optimistic that the end of 2021 would lead to great changes that would ultimately help me reach my goals. Unfortunately, not all of these were necessarily reached in the way I was hoping for.\nI didn’t reach my fitness goals I had set at the end of 2021. While I didn’t necessarily make things worse in the last year, I didn’t progress in the way I was hoping for.\nI also didn’t reach my game development goals I was hoping I’d make in 2022 either. My next game has run into various creative blocks I didn’t experience in my first game, and I wasn’t able to flesh out the story for my game in a way I was satisfied with.\nLastly, despite prioritizing my social life and its stability in 2022, I didn’t meet my goals there. While my social situation has definitely improved compared to a year ago, I struggled with meeting people locally and relied on rekindling past friendships and acquaintanceships to rebuild my social life. That was a viable strategy that helped my situation, don’t get me wrong, but I didn’t meet many new people as a result. I’m hopeful that I can expand my social horizons in 2023 and be more of the friend I wish that I had growing up to others."
