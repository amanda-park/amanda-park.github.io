I thought about high school, a time of my life I generally don’t like to think about very often. I wondered just what happened to me back then that ended up positively informing my behaviors as the adult I am today, and I thought of classes that played a role in that process. The ones I identified as useful in that regard are below:"

Your classes will probably vary from mine, of course. But knowing your past and what helped influence you is valuable, and can help you be influenced positively in the future."

    "text": "Plotly Is The Best Visualization Tool\nOne thing that I really struggled with in regards to using Python was its comparatively lackluster visualization options. Matplotlib and Seaborn are certainly functional plotting libraries, but compared to R’s ggplot2 the visualizations were not up to snuff.\nThat’s where Plotly comes in. Plotly is a multi-platform library that supports JavaScript, R, and Python. In R, Plotly can seamlessly wrap around any ggplot object and make it an interactive plot, which makes it incredibly convenient to use. In Python, there is a low-code plotting option called plotly.express that can use for a similar effect, but there’s also the functionality for building more complex plots layer by layer.\nPlotly is also convenient because you can borrow themes from other common plotting libraries and have them applied to your plots by changing one parameter. For standardizing visualizations between R and Python, Plotly has been a lifesaver. (For a project our team tried using PlotNine for standardizing visuals, and it was clunky.)\nIn fact, I’ve found Plotly so nice in Python that I’m developing a library which saves the plot configurations for the ones used most frequently in my current role."

    "section": "Object Oriented Programming Isn’t That Scary",
    "text": "Object Oriented Programming Isn’t That Scary\nCoding in an object-oriented programming manner in R is far from intuitive. There are multiple class structures to choose from, and more often than not you can get by with putting your reusable code in a function and be fine.\nAdmittedly coding in functions also works in Python, but since it’s known as an object oriented programming language, open-source “Pythonic” code will follow the OOP structure more frequently. The first time I was exposed to it in Python code I found it foreign. It seemed needlessly complicated and clunky for most data science workflows.\nHowever, implementing a class-based structure in certain situations can be beneficial. Something that’s now obvious to me after working in a larger organization is the importance of code sustainability and reusability. By programming in a standardized format like OOP, that organization makes it easier for others to follow and work with your code. It’s not necessarily fun (at least to me) to write code in such a manner, and sometimes it just makes a simple data science ask overly complicated. But for code that you expect to reuse, the benefits can make restructuring your code worthwhile."

(I know Spyder is somewhat like R Markdown, but it’s not as robust.)\nHowever, Sphinx helps fill the gap as a companion guide. Creating documentation is as easy as having properly formatted docstrings and running a few lines of code on the command line. It makes worth both more reproducible and easier to remember if/when you have to go back to it. (And personally I think readthedocs is a bit less finnicky than using pkgdown, R’s equivalent.

Visualizations are one of the easiest ways to get away with doing this and tell a story that in all actuality may not be true at all.\nEdward Tufte was a statistician and artist, and he was acutely aware of this problem too. He’s known for writing books such as The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, which is a classic regarding how to create statistical visualization. In the book, he discusses four principles:\nFor today’s post I’m going to focus on the first principle."

    "text": "Don’t lie, distort the data, or mislead the reader\nTo create ethical visualizations, the data needs to be presented in a fair way. That is, the representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface of the graphic itself, should be directly proportional to the number of quantities represented.\nTufte mathematically represented this idea with an equation called the Lie Factor. The Lie Factor is the size of the effect shown in a graphic divided by the size of the effect in the data. Values over 1 overstate the effect.\nNow all that may sound intimidating, but with a few pictures hopefully the idea will be clearer.\nBelow is a graphic that shows this in action:\n\n\n\nlie\n\n\nNotice the doctor’s width and height changes, which causes readers to be misled and think that the effect is much larger. In this visual, the lie factor is around 2.8. Here is another (what I consider more egregious) example:\n\n\n\nlie2\n\n\nNotice that the width difference highly distorts the actual change relative to the improvement that was seen. A 53% change looks much larger due to the drastically different size in the length of fuel effiency. If one looks solely at the lengths, it shows a 783% improvement!\n\nHow To Avoid This?\nFor both of these examples, if the effects were shown with a basic bar chart, the effect would not be distorted like this example. Clear labeling would also have helped these visuals to be more easily interpretable. For example, if we made a bar chart of the doctor example, label your y-axis with 0 as the starting point, plot the bars at the appropriate value for the value each doctor had in that year, and then keep the bar widths all the same. That alone would make the visual more accurate.\nIn general, be suspicious when graphs don’t start their y-value at 0 in something like bar graphs. Without having that frame of reference in a visual, the effect of a change will appear far larger than it actually is."

I learned a lot of useful information in these books that I felt would be useful to share with other people in some capacity.\nI also realized that getting the job I wanted right out of grad school would be challenging. I identify myself as a generalist over a specialist, so I figured that building an app would be a helpful review of coding outside the programming language of R, which I exclusively used in school.\nI then decided making an Android App was the answer. I would develop a guidebook that covered various mental health techniques for people to have on their phone when they needed it. Beyond hitting the aforementioned desires, it would also be a cool thing that I could tell others I built as well (both personally and professionally)."

I learned pretty quickly that when you don’t code in a language for a few years, it can take a while to knock off the dust and get comfortable using the syntax of the language again.\nThen I downloaded Android Studio. It’s a powerful interface for developing apps, but I would not describe it as intuitive to a newcomer. There was a pretty hefty learning curve where I had to learn navigating the GUI and understanding both the formatting and location of files in an application.\nI came across many different terms I had not heard before. Before building this app, I couldn’t tell you what the difference between a fragment and an activity was. I didn’t know anything about user interface (UI) design prior to this, and through trial and error I learned what kept the app both functional and fast. I would by no means say I made the app pretty (I am a stick figure artist at heart), but I was happy with how it turned out visually."

    "text": "The Challenges I Faced\nBut before I became happy with how it turned out, I ran into a few major issues that I’ve realized are endemic to many projects. You may recognize some of these in your own experiences, and perhaps they are a rite of passage that all developers have to learn eventually.\n\nScope Creep\nI almost let my initial idea for an app become so complex that it stopped me from completing it. My app ended up with far more content than I ever intended it to initially. When I first started building it I wanted to focus on having just a few things available for people, and to build on if I was interested later with new features.\nThat didn’t happen, though. I decided that I should cover more therapies and make the app more robust, which added to development time. An app that could have reasonably been completed months earlier wasn’t because I decided I needed to tinker with it until it met my standards.\nIn hindsight, if I had planned this app out more carefully rather than put it together as I went, I could have avoided this scope creep. Now that I have experience working in a large-scale organization, I have also seen scope creep affect other projects and believe that I am better equipped to resist the pull of a “bigger and better” result.\n\n\nNot Using Version Control\nYeah, I know. I can feel the glares coming through the screen. If you look in the GitHub repository of my code for this project, you’ll see that there are old versions of files that are in there. However, I did not go out of my way to put them there. That only happened because Windows periodically backed up my save files, not because I went out of my way to do so.\n(In newer versions of Android Studio version control is automatically built into the application. So perhaps I would have practiced better version control habits for reproducibility purpose had this feature been built in a year ago.)\nAnyway, the reason this was a learning lesson because I lost time and progress because I didn’t practice good version control habits. At one point, my strings.xml file had its format altered, and my app because unusable as a result. It took hours to fix a change that, with proper version control, I could have just reverted to a previous version in a minute. Sometimes you just have to learn those lessons the hard way to realize their importance, I suppose.\n\n\nNot Commenting Well Enough\nThis one plagued me when I took breaks between working on this project. I was lazy with commenting what new features I added to this application and just assumed I would remember what I was doing months ago. Unsurprisingly, I regularly forgot what changes I made and had to spend time re-learning something all over again, when commenting would have saved trouble in the long run.\nIt’s embarrassing looking back how little I kept track of what every step of my code did, and one of the major lessons learned I took away from this project was to comment any future work thoroughly in such a way that I would not be confused when I looked back at it later on. (Thankfully when using R it’s easy to use R Markdown files, and when using Python Jupyter Notebooks allows for Markdown and code chunks. So it’s become standard practice when I have to code on the job for me now, to the point of seeming excessive to my colleagues.)"

I’ve gotten some experience with managing people and projects in this last year as well, which should serve me well with respect to my future career goals.\n\n\nCreating a “Second Brain”\nThis year, I came across the concept of a Second Brain after reading a book on the topic by Tiago Forte. A Second Brain (in non-self-help) terms is basically an organized digital space where any ideas, thoughts, or other information you might want to look back on in the future are stored.\nI’ve used OneNote since I started my current role, becoming a huge fan of its search feature in particular to find old notes. But while I enjoyed OneNote, I still wasn’t using it to its fullest potential since I wasn’t keeping it well-organized. I’d throw notes in wherever and hope that the search function would help me find whatever I had written down.\nNow, I’m much more deliberate with the process. It took many hours to organize my OneNote but now it’s much easier to find where things are located. Further, since notes are now in more logical areas, I can connect concepts together that previously I might have entirely missed out on.\nI know it sounds weird that one of my big wins this year basically amounted to being more disciplined and organizing better, but something clicked with me this year to take digital organization seriously. I firmly believe this change will pay huge dividends long-term for my personal development.\n\n\nTravel\nThis year I had the opportunity to travel to some different locations I hadn’t been previously.\nThe highlight of the year’s trips was one that I took to Colorado in the summer, which included visiting a zany museum in Denver called Meow Wolf:\n\n\n\nMeow Wolf - Convergence Station\n\n\nVisiting Black Canyon National Park:\n\n\n\nBlack Canyon of the Gunnison National Park\n\n\nAnd Rocky Mountain National Park:\n\n\n\nRocky Mountain National Park\n\n\nIt was my first time being in a different time zone, a mile above sea level, visiting a US national park, and in a desert.

Family members have had their health deteriorate due to cancer on both sides, which has increased long-running tensions. Further, I had to reset my social life after moving, and that’s taken up a lot of my time and energy.\nProfessionally, my workplace (Spectrum) merged with another health system (Beaumont) and rebranded themselves as Corewell Health. There’s not been any direct changes yet to my role, but mergers inherently come with additional stress. Though there’s been no direct changes to my role since the promotion, I will have a new boss in early 2023 as Corewell hires a director to grow its data science capabilities. While there’s a great opportunity with that transition, there’s always uncertainty whenever your manager changes.\nThen there’s been the general stressors that are societal, such as the economy, climate change, politics, etc. I won’t go into detail on those here, but living in interesting times isn’t what I’d call relaxing by any means.\n\n\nMissed Goals\nI was optimistic that the end of 2021 would lead to great changes that would ultimately help me reach my goals. Unfortunately, not all of these were necessarily reached in the way I was hoping for.\nI didn’t reach my fitness goals I had set at the end of 2021.

My next game has run into various creative blocks I didn’t experience in my first game, and I wasn’t able to flesh out the story for my game in a way I was satisfied with.\nLastly, despite prioritizing my social life and its stability in 2022, I didn’t meet my goals there. While my social situation has definitely improved compared to a year ago, I struggled with meeting people locally and relied on rekindling past friendships and acquaintanceships to rebuild my social life. That was a viable strategy that helped my situation, don’t get me wrong, but I didn’t meet many new people as a result.

Additionally, my workplace offered up LinkedIn Learning for all employees, so that has aided me in rounding out my skillset.\nPersonally speaking, I learned about the various facets of game development (of which there are many).

Not having normal relaxation methods available made it really hard to deal with, even as an introvert.\nI know various virtual avenues are available for socializing, but having a Zoom call with someone just isn’t the same as interacting with them in person. In general, when “normal” returns a lot of us are going to come out of this more socially awkward than we started. I already feel more social anxiety than I have in years on the rare occasions I do interact with people in person now, and it remains to be seen how long that will take to recede to previous levels.\n\n\nI Miss The Gym\nStaying at home makes it even easier to slide into a sedentary lifestyle. I try to mitigate that by working out on a regular basis, but it’s also closely related to maintaining my mental health. Over the years I’ve learned I work out best going when going to a fitness facility. However maintaining my physical health has been tricky with having to stay indoors, especially now that we’re approaching winter. It’s much harder to motivate myself when I’m always in my apartment and there’s no dedicated workout area. I have managed to stay at least vaguely in shape with Ring Fit Adventure (a Nintendo Switch video game) but I’m definitely not where I want to be fitness-wise.\n\n\nPolitical Tensions\nThe leadup to the 2020 election in America was a nightmare I think we’d all prefer to forget. The fallout, where Trump is still insisting he won despite all objective sources of truth saying otherwise, is undermining democracy as we know it. Millions of people have been laid off and are broke to the point of shoplifting baby food for their children due to inadequate COVID funding. Our government still hasn’t taken any meaningful action to stop mass shootings or address systemic racism. Following politics is just downright depressing.\nSure, the stock market looks great, but there’s a storm brewing with how desperate people are getting. I suspect we’ll see more fallout in 2021 from this, especially if the government doesn’t give people the assistance needed to survive."

However, a silver lining of remote work is that data analytics jobs don’t necessarily need to be done in a specific location, so I was able to leverage that to buy a place that’s much closer to where my family is located.\nAlthough buying a house has more stressors associated with it than renting does, I will say I appreciate the increased space, peace and quiet, and lower cost of living I’ve been afforded being able to move out of a larger city.\n\n\nMaking My First Game\nAs I referenced in a previous post, I made my first game, Edge of Chaos! Now that I have the confidence and learnings of that experience, I look forward to making the game I’ve always dreamed of over the next few years.\n\n\nThe Vaccine Making Travel Safer\nI had opportunities to travel in 2021, especially with being able to get vaccinated all the way back in January.\nI was able to visit my family in Florida:\n\nVisit Frederick Meijer Garden (highly recommended):\n\n\n\nFrederick Meijer Garden - Cherry Blossoms\n\n\nSaw a sunset on Lake Michigan (at the insistence of my coworkers) on the longest day of the year, which given that Michigan is on the edge of Eastern Standard Time, happened at 10 PM:\n\n\n\nLake Michigan\n\n\nSee stunning landscapes in Sleeping Bear Dunes:\n\n\n\nSleeping Bear Dunes\n\n\nAnd go to Philadelphia for the first time whilst attending PAX Unplugged:\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia, City of Stop Beating Up The Giants So Badly Please\n\n\nOverall, my 2021 was WAY more active than 2020."

    "text": "The Bad of 2021\n\nMore COVID Troubles\nNew variants, continued strain on the healthcare system, the politicizing of basic protections against the disease, and burnout are but a few of the problems that we all faced in the continued marathon against COVID-19. Many hospital systems are overrun with the Omicron variant and due to global mismanagement of vaccines, new variants will inevitably crop up going into 2022.\nThe economic fallout of the pandemic also can’t be underestimated. Inflation is at 6.8% in November 2021, the highest it’s been in 40 years. (Due to inflation we are also seeing shrinkflation and skimpflation, so that number is probably underestimating its true impact.) To combat inflation, interest rates will have to rise, which may cause yet another stock market tumble/recession.\n\n\nMental Health Struggles\nLoneliness cropped up pretty hard on me for parts of 2021, making it hard to function at the level that I would like to. Being able to move near the end of the year made things easier, but for the majority of the year prior to the move, outside of the travel referenced above, I barely met up with anyone. The prolonged isolation has impacted my personality and way of coping with stress, though with being closer to home I won’t be nearly as isolated for 2022.\nWith the loneliness my desire to follow healthy habits has also taken a hit. One of my main goals for 2022 is to get in good physical shape again, since 2 years of WFH and emotional eating haven’t done my body any favors. (It’s not as bad as it could be, but I could really be doing better in this regard and need to make some changes sooner rather than later.)\n\n\nTransitions\nThere’s obviously the hassle of moving states that is a part of this transition. But there’s more change going on in my career as well. The relative stability of my job last year has been in flux, with 3 different managers in 1 year, changing departments, and having the way work is completed be done through a new process in SAFe. Many favorite coworkers of mine have left for greener pastures, which is always hard to watch.\nHowever, the anxiety from transitions should alleviate since I won’t have to worry about where I’m living for a while, what with buying a house and all. So this downside likely won’t appear to this extent in any future years of my life (or at least I hope not)."

    "text": "The Good of 2023\n\nMore Travel Goals Met\nI was able to travel quite a bit this year, including going to the following areas:\n\nWisconsin\nNational Parks near Las Vegas and Maine\nNew Orleans\n\nTo start off, here are the national parks I managed to visit. There was a few in July, including the Grand Canyon:\n\n\n\nGrand Canyon - Bright Angel Point\n\n\nBryce Canyon National Park:\n\n\n\nBryce Canyon - Queens/Navajo Combination Loop\n\n\nand Zion National Park:\n\n\n\nZion National Park - The Narrows\n\n\nAdditionally, I was able to hit Acadia in September:\n\n\n\nAcadia - Beehive Loop\n\n\nBesides national parks, I was also was able to go to New Orleans in December:\n\n\n\nNew Orleans - French Quarter\n\n\nOverall, I’ve knocked off even more places that were on my travel bucket list in 2023, and I’m looking forward to visiting some more places in 2024.\n\n\nFinding Peace in Doing Things Alone\nIn June, I was lucky enough to be able to take a solo trip for a work conference. This was the first time I had ever traveled across states without knowing a single person at the location I went to (I’ve traveled alone in airplanes, but usually friends/family awaited me at the airport).\nGetting a rental car and exploring an unfamiliar area solo was nerve-wracking, especially as there were a few anxiety-inducing situations that happened on the trip (getting attacked by birds, a deer almost running into me, and learning I get claustrophobic in caves). However, I’m glad I took advantage of the opportunity my workplace gave me and did the trip.\n\n\n\nMadison - Olbrich Botanical Gardens\n\n\nI tried to take that approach into other areas of my life, including solo hiking and attending local events by myself throughout the year. These were easier to do solo than a trip to another state, and I’m slowly getting better at putting myself out there at events where I don’t know another soul in attendance. I still don’t like it, but I am building confidence in the fact that I can indeed do it.\n\n\nA More Optimal Financial Setup\nThis isn’t a particularly “fun” topic, but I took another look at my financial setup and finally opened up a high-yield savings account to take advantage of high interest rates. This isn’t exactly a life-altering change, but it has resulted in me making more in interest on my liquid savings, and every little bit helps as I consider my future financial goals."

    "text": "The Bad of 2023\n\nLoneliness is Relentless\nUnfortunately I had a family member pass early in January from cancer, which really didn’t set a good tone for how 2023 was going to go. This led to some infighting amongst my extended family, which is never any fun to deal with.\nUltimately, the above was a wake-up call to a bitter truth that I needed to swallow. I grieved and accepted I won’t have the family relationships that I wish I did. I’m not like the rest of my family; for example, most of them were lucky to graduate high school, yet I obtained a Master’s degree. I recognize overall it’s not a bad thing to be different in this situation, but I won’t lie, it’s easy to feel envious of others who do have those relationships in their life.\nI also didn’t make any progress in building more meaningful relationships (romantic, platonic, or otherwise) in 2023. (This feels embarrassing to type out, as this has been a goal of mine for years now.) I know it wasn’t for a lack of effort, as I focused on local in-person events and Meetup groups for 2023. Unfortunately, they simply didn’t pan out as I hoped.\nI’m trying to approach this disappointment with radical acceptance, telling myself that “it is what it is” and that my self-worth is not defined by the quality and/or quantity of relationships I have currently in my life. I’m also trying to cut myself some slack; most people would struggle with loneliness if they had to spend effectively two years completely isolated due to COVID, WFH, and living in a new location.\n\n\nHealth Stressors\nIn the early months of 2023, I dealt with muscle twitching across my entire body. For a while I thought this was due to handling stress poorly, but I eventually was able to remedy the issue by upping my calcium intake (pro-tip for anyone who runs into this issue!), but when it happened near constantly for months on end prior, I was incredibly stressed out."

    "text": "Personal Reasons For Buying Now\n\nBeing Closer to Home\nWhen I moved out here for this job, I was confident that I would be able to establish a strong social network like I did in grad school to help me get acclimated to a new area. However, my plan was derailed for a couple key reasons: * General increased difficulty making friends out of college * The pandemic\nI anticipated the former, and was lucky enough to befriend coworkers at my current workplace. That helped out when I was going to the office every day, but between adjusting to a new area and a new job I didn’t have a lot of time to invest in building a social network in the area. I was planning to develop that more strongly once I had my footing at my new job…\nAnd then COVID-19 said hello. That derailed any plans I had for meeting people in person, forcing social interactions to become remote in the name of public safety. I went months communicating with people only through electronic means, and the effect on my mental health was not pleasant. As an introvert, I was able to weather the effects of the consistent isolation better than most, but I was not immune to feeling lonely and depressed from the current reality.\nHowever, COVID-19 also offered a silver lining. Despite the tragic nature of everything that has happened, it accelerated the push towards remote work. Previously I was in the office every day, and in a world without COVID-19, that would still be the case. I would need to find another job closer to where I wanted to live to be closer to my established support network.\nBut in this new normal, I can keep my current job and work in a location more convenient for me (thankfully I work somewhere that’s willing to be flexible in that sense). That gives me confidence to live in a fixed location and not rely on the renting indefinitely.\n\n\nBad Landlords\nWhen I rented in grad school, I had a very good landlord. There was occasional noise from neighbors that bugged me, but because it was in a college town and mostly full of grad school residents, the quality was solid. Repairs were made in a timely fashion and even though my apartment was tiny and lacked a dishwasher, I managed.\nWhile my current apartment has more amenities (like a dishwasher, central air, and nearly double the square footage space), it also has incompetent management. I have had a hole in my ceiling for over 3 months now due to a leak in the apartment above me, and maintenance has still not fixed it. I was without consistent heat last winter for over a month due to poor fixes to my apartment’s heating system. Stomping is regularly heard by neighbors above me, and I clearly hear domestic disputes in a next-door apartment. Rent increases are at the whim of my landlord, and due to living in a growing area, have made a previously affordable cost of living increasingly more expensive.\nAt this point, I have realized my values of privacy and quiet are nearly impossible to get in most apartment complexes. You have no control over your neighbors when renting, but with a house you can control the noise (and screen the nearby houses to make sure you are okay with potential neighbors).\n\n\nStability\nA house offers you a stable place that you can live, whereas renting does not offer that flexibility. My current landlord has decided on renovations for my building, thus forcing everyone to move in a couple of months, regardless of their tenant status. After having to move 4 times in 4 years, I’m tired of hauling around all my crap long distances and paying both the financial and physical/emotional costs associated with moving.\nI’m ready to have a stable place to live. My mental health will benefit being in one location consistently, as the anxiety of being in a location only temporarily was not the type of stress I was built to handle well. The ability to put down roots and connect to a local community will offer me a lot of peace of mind."

    "text": "Financial Reasons For Buying Now\n\nLow Interest Rates\nInterest rates for mortgages are near an all-time low. Previously interest rates would vary between 6-15%, but right now rates are around 3%. This has led to an influx of external investors coming in to buy single-family homes in particular, the reasons of which could make its own disturbing article. Even if it’s hard for most people to take advantage of the low interest rates in this fire-hot housing market, I wanted to see what I could manage given the ability to buy a house in a lower cost of living and slightly less desirable area.\n\n\nRising Rents\nIn the area I currently live in, the rent for my apartment have risen over 10% in the two years I’ve lived there. Mortgages, even 30-year fixed mortgages, can experience increases through property taxes and insurance; however, the increases experienced through those reasons are already built into any landlord’s rent payments.\n\n\nHigh Inflation\nRight now we’re currently in a period of high inflation. When inflation is high, taking on fixed-interest debt is a solid strategy, as the value of the loan deteriorates due to the devaluing of the dollar.\n\n\nAbility to Put 20% Down in Cash\nThere are mortgages available where you do not need to have a 20% down payment of cash at the ready to get a house, particularly mortgages for first-time homebuyers. I considered these options, but decided to stick with a traditional mortgage structure for a couple of reasons:\n\nHaving substantial equity in the home in case of an economic downturn\nAvoiding paying PMI (Personal Mortgage Insurance)\n\nIn the case of the former, I do not expect a market downturn given recent behavior in the housing market. This is mainly due to inflation, lack of new housing, and investment firms buying many single family homes to make into AirBnbs/permanent rentals. However, if one were to occur and the value of my home decreased, by putting 20% down I hedge against being “underwater”, where the amount of debt I owe on the home is worth more than the house’s value.\nIn the case of the latter, PMI is an additional expense that a lender would expect you to pay if you put down less than 20% for a mortgage. The less you put down for a home, the most it costs. For the price range of homes I was looking for, it’s not a huge expense on its own, but on top of paying more in interest and that added monthly payment, over time it adds up. Admittedly there’s an opportunity cost to putting money towards a home and say, not in the stock market; however, I have invested other money towards retirement and felt the peace of mind with having a house beat the uncertainty associated with renting."

I don’t think it’s as black and white as that. My situation to finally buy a house was a combination of many factors:\n\nA high-paying stable job that I enjoy\nThe ability to work remotely indefinitely\nNo student loans\nHigh credit scores\nHaving 20% down for a mortgage payment AND 6% to cover closing costs associated with buying a house in savings/checking\nMoney invested in retirement through 401(k) and a Roth IRA\nPersonal and financial reasons listed above\n\nIf it weren’t for all those factors, buying a home would be a much harder psychological sell. The money for my down payment and closing costs could easily be put in the stock market, which if invested properly could average a return greater than the appreciation of the value of a house. I’d have the flexibility to move in case I wanted to live elsewhere. I wouldn’t need to mow a lawn or shovel my own driveway.\nBut for all the reasons listed above, the time to get out of the rent race was now. I stayed within my budget for buying a home, not going above 2.5 times my annual income for the final cost. (General rule of thumb I found online.) The house I live in will be much larger and nicer than an apartment, and I know it’s mine. For that alone, it was worth it."

For the longest time, I found making this choice very overwhelming, and I struggled with figuring out which would be most appropriate for me.\nThere are many choices out there for game development in 2020. There are the engines geared towards people who aren’t coders, such as RPG Maker and Game Maker Studio. There are the very popular engines such as Unity or Unreal. And then there are the more niche, open source engines like Godot or Ren’Py. I considered all of these engines as potential choices for game creation, but the main two I’ve given more than a cursory glance towards were Godot and RPG Maker."

    "text": "What to Avoid with Pixel Art\nIt doesn’t matter what tool you use if you don’t manage to avoid the pitfalls of creating pixel art. There a few main things you want to avoid when creating pixel art. (And if you want to know more, I highly recommend checking out Pixel Logic: A Guide to Pixel Art).\n\nJaggies\nWhen you draw in such a small scale, you need to watch out for how your lines are constructed, or else the line will look clunky. Jaggies occur when the length of lines makes a line you want to appear smooth look jagged instead. An example of what this looks like and how to fix it is below:\n\n\n\nSource: Pixel Logic\n\n\n\n\nBanding\nBanding happens when you try and shade an image perfectly around its border. This was something I intuitively did when I first started working with images and it made my art rough around the edges. Again, an example of what this looks like and how to avoid it is below. The biggest thing with banding is to try shading with different colors to avoid things looking blurry when zoomed out.\n\n\n\nSource: Pixel Logic\n\n\n\n\nAnti-Aliasing\nThe last point I found interesting in my pixel art journey (though there are many things) is anti-aliasing. It’s a technique meant to make pixel art easier to decipher by blurring pixels around a color transition. There are pros and cons to using anti-aliasing, so it depends on the specific sprite you’re working on whether or not you want to employ the technique.\n\n\n\nSource: Pixel Logic"

There’s no one template for this approach, as each situation is different and each person’s reactions to a crisis will vary. There are a few different generalized responses to a crisis, though:\n\nThree General Responses to Crisis\nEustress - a person in this group generally is functional after a crisis and can take care of their needs with little to no emotional suffering\nDistress - this group is generally able to get done what needs to get done, but there’s an obvious emotional strain that wears on them.\nDysfunction - this group is not able to get their basic needs met and is psychologically impaired.\n\n\nDifference Between Distress and Dysfunction\nIt can be hard to distinguish between distress and dysfunction. A person may only be in temporary distress and then function fine after a certain period of time, or they may regress into a dysfunctional state. There are a few domains that can be looked at to determine whether a person is in distress or dysfunction:\nCognitive - distress may manifest as temporary confusion, inability to concentrate, and being overwhelmed; dysfunction can manifest as hopelessness, suicidal thoughts, and hallucinations.\nEmotional - distress may manifest as fear, anxiety, sadness, and anger; dysfunction may manifest as panic attacks, immobilizing depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nBehavioral - distress may manifest as disturbances in eating and sleeping patterns and being easily startled; dysfunction may manifest as reclusiveness and self-medication.\nSpiritual - distress may involve a questioning of one’s faith; dysfunction may include projecting one’s faith onto others or abandoning religion entirely.\nPhysiologic - distress may manifest as a change in appetite or libido, dysfunction may manifest as a change in either cardiac or gastrointestinal function.\nBy looking at all these different domains you can see a general trend of when someone may be in distress compared to being in dysfunction."

The main goal is to assess basic functional capacity and that someone can do what they need to in order to survive.\n\nTwo Approaches to Triage\nEvidence-based triage mainly focuses on seeing examples of diminished capacity. This includes an inability to perform self-care, acting hopeless, and a reduced awareness of the consequences of one’s actions.\nRisk-based triage focuses on three D’s: whether a person was forced to confront death (whether threatened with it or having to see human remains), dislocation (whether separated from loved ones or a place to call home), and disabling impact (whether there was a physical injury or dissociation).\nOf course, risk-based triage can help to guide an approach, but it should be combined with evidence-based triage to obtain the best results."

    "text": "Intervention\nThe purpose of the intervention step is to attend to basic needs, mitigate acute psychological distress, and if possible, restore acute functional capacity. For some people, this step really just requires a listening ear, but others may require more prevalent social support. A general outline that can be followed as a script is:\n\nIntroduce self and explain your presence\nAsk about the person’s well-being\nAsk about the situation\nClarify ambiguity along the way (ie, when a person says they’re depressed, what exactly do they mean?)\n\nAfter going through that script, there are generally two ways to approach an intervention. If the person appears psychologically unstable (example: they’re having a panic attack), the main goal to focus on is stabilization. This can be done through using distraction and clearing the situation of any triggering cues. However, if the person appears to be stable but in acute distress, approaches such as reframing, reassurance, and normalization of feelings can be effective."

If a person appears capable of taking care of himself, then the process has ended. Following up on someone is a useful approach to make sure that they are still doing well. However, if it seems multiple follow-ups are needed to see how someone is doing, that’s when further professional care would be of assistance.\nHowever, after this if a person does not seem able to function independently, then immediate access to further support is necessary, and the most appropriate support varies depending on the specific situation."

At the time, I hated it because it led to a lot of extra work to complete assignments. In reality, the datasets he gave weren’t really that messy at all compared to real-life data, and if I had known how to clean and manipulate data through the tidyverse package in R, it wouldn’t have taken long at all to do that step of the assignment.\nThe best place to learn how to use the tidyverse is easily R for Data Science. What makes learning R great is that there recently have been a lot of nice online textbooks that have come out that teach both the basics and advanced concepts, so it’s usually pretty easy to pick up on how to do certain things."

Further, it got me into some bad habits coding-wise, so frequently my code (while it was functional) was a pain to follow logically.\nIf I had used R Markdown from the start and just submitted files that way (though I’m not sure if my program would have allowed it), I would have saved a LOT of time. I had to screenshot way too many outputs from R and insert them into LaTeX, but R allows you to embed both numeric outputs and images into an exported PDF and/or HTML file. Further, since Markdown is much easier to format and understand than LaTeX, writing up assessments on assignments would have been much easier.\nIn my current job, I don’t create reports or assessments through R Markdown - I mostly just use it as a way to organize my coding thoughts so it’s easier for others to follow along. And I’m now spoiled by R (well, R Studio’s) ability to handle R Markdown files in general compared to Python, because no matter what, Spyder and Jupyter Notebooks can’t compete with what R Markdown has to offer."

Being primarily a language for statistical analysis, a lot of pure software developers don’t use R, and so the majority of users (though this has gotten better in recent years) instead write code that isn’t intended necessarily for reusability.\nI was guilty of this in grad school. I wrote code ad-hoc for assignments basically all the time, and it became a habit to just copy-paste code when assignments had overlapping uses. Each question in an assignment was different enough that the process couldn’t be standardized in any meaningful way.\nNow that I’ve been learning about software development and best practices associated with that, I realize just how wasteful and inefficient a lot of my previous code was. I’ve been learning about how Python is an object-oriented programming language, and while it’s not natural for me to think about coding things in classes just yet (especially in R, since classes are much different there), I now see obvious opportunities to make my code more reusable for future asks. I’ve learned how to properly make my own functions and (most importantly) make them general enough to be reusable for a variety of different situations."

It’s flexible enough to work for both classification and regression problems, and includes most of the popular machine learning algorithms you would want to use for your analysis.\nIf you use R in your day to day workflow at all, I highly recommend using Tidymodels. An online textbook called Tidy Modeling with R is currently still in development, but covers the basics.\n(For what it’s worth, I’ve also heard good things about mlr3 from people at work, but I have not had an opportunity to fully explore it yet.
