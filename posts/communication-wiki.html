<p><strong>Chuck Klosterman’s 23 Questions</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Let us assume you met a rudimentary magician. Let us assume he can do five simple tricks—he can pull a rabbit out of his hat, he can make a coin disappear, he can turn the ace of spades into the Joker card, and two others in a similar vein. These are his only tricks and he can’t learn any more; he can only do these five. HOWEVER, it turns out he’s doing these five tricks with real magic. It’s not an illusion; he can actually conjure the bunny out of the ether and he can move the coin through space. He’s legitimately magical, but extremely limited in scope and influence. Would this person be more impressive than Albert Einstein?</li>
<li>Let us assume a fully grown, completely healthy Clydesdale horse has his hooves shackled to the ground while his head is held in place with thick rope. He is conscious and standing upright, but completely immobile. And let us assume that—for some reason—every political prisoner on earth (as cited by Amnesty International) will be released from captivity if you can kick this horse to death in less than twenty minutes. You are allowed to wear steel-toed boots. Would you attempt to do this?</li>
<li>Let us assume there are two boxes on a table. In one box, there is a relatively normal turtle; in the other, Adolf Hitler’s skull. You have to select one of these items for your home. If you select the turtle, you can’t give it away and you have to keep it alive for two years; if either of these parameters are not met, you will be fined 999 dollars by the state. If you select Hitler’s skull, you are required to display it in a semi-prominent location in your living room for the same amount of time, although you will be paid a stipend of 120 per month for doing so. Display of the skull must be apolitical. Which option do you select?</li>
<li>Genetic engineers at Johns Hopkins University announce that they have developed a so-called “super gorilla.” Though the animal cannot speak, it has a sign language lexicon of over twelve thousand words, an I.Q. of almost 85, and—most notably—a vague sense of self-awareness. Oddly, the creature (who weighs seven hundred pounds) becomes fascinated by football. The gorilla aspires to play the game at its highest level and quickly develops the rudimentary skills of a defensive end. ESPN analyst Tom Jackson speculates that this gorilla would be “borderline unblockable” and would likely average six sacks a game (although Jackson concedes the beast might be susceptible to counters and misdirection plays). Meanwhile, the gorilla has made it clear he would never intentionally injure any opponent. You are commissioner of the NFL: Would you allow this gorilla to sign with the Oakland Raiders?</li>
<li>You meet your soul mate. However, there is a catch: Every three years, someone will break both of your soul mate’s collarbones with a Crescent wrench, and there is only one way you can stop this from happening: You must swallow a pill that will make every song you hear—for the rest of your life—sound as if it’s being performed by the band Alice in Chains. When you hear Creedence Clearwater Revival on the radio, it will sound (to your ears) like it’s being played by Alice in Chains. If you see Radiohead live, every one of their tunes will sound like it’s being covered by Alice in Chains. When you hear a commercial jingle on TV, it will sound like Alice in Chains; if you sing to yourself in the shower, your voice will sound like deceased Alice vocalist Layne Staley performing a capella (but it will only sound this way to you). Would you swallow the pill?</li>
<li>At long last, someone invents “the dream VCR.” This machine allows you to tape an entire evening’s worth of your own dreams, which you can then watch at your leisure. However, the inventor of the dream VCR will only allow you to use this device of you agree to a strange caveat: When you watch your dreams, you must do so with your family and your closest friends in the same room. They get to watch your dreams along with you. And if you don’t agree to this, you can’t use the dream VCR. Would you still do this?</li>
<li>Defying all expectation, a group of Scottish marine biologists capture a live Loch Ness Monster. In an almost unbelievable coincidence, a bear hunter in the Pacific Northwest shoots a Sasquatch in the thigh, thereby allowing zoologists to take the furry monster into captivity. These events happen on the same afternoon. That evening, the president announces he may have thyroid cancer and will undergo a biopsy later that week. You are the front page editor of The New York Times: What do you play as the biggest story?</li>
<li>You meet the perfect person. Romantically, this person is ideal: You find them physically attractive, intellectually stimulating, consistently funny, and deeply compassionate. However, they have one quirk: This individual is obsessed with Jim Henson’s gothic puppet fantasy The Dark Crystal. Beyond watching it on DVD at least once a month, he/she peppers casual conversation with Dark Crystal references, uses Dark Crystal analogies to explain everyday events, and occasionally likes to talk intensely about the film’s “deeper philosophy.” Would this be enough to stop you from marrying this individual?</li>
<li>A novel titled Interior Mirror is released to mammoth commerical success (despite middling reviews). However, a curious social trend emerges: Though no one can prove a direct scientific link, it appears that almost 30 percent of the people who read this book immediately become homosexual. Many of these newfound homosexuals credit the book for helping them reach this conclusion about their orientation, despite the fact that Interior Mirror is ostensibly a crime novel with no homoerotic content (and was written by a straight man). Would this phenomenon increase (or decrease) the likliehood of you reading this book?</li>
<li>This is the opening line of Jay McInerney’s Bright Lights, Big City: “You are not the kind of guy who would be in a place like this at this time of the morning.” Think about that line in the context of the novel (assuming you’ve read it). Now go to your CD collection and find Heart’s Little Queen album (assuming you own it). Listen to the opening riff to “Barracuda.” Which of these two introductions is a higher form of art?</li>
<li>You are watching a movie in a crowded theater. Though the plot is mediocre, you find yourself dazzled by the special effects. But with twenty minutes left in the film, you are struck with an undeniable feeling of doom: You are suddenly certain your mother has just died. There is no logical reason for this to be true, but you are certain of it. You are overtaken with the irrational metaphysical sense that—somewhere—your mom has just perished. But this is only an intuitive, amorphous feeling; there is no evidence for this, and your mother has not been ill. Would you immediately exit the theater, or would you finish watching the movie?</li>
<li>You meet a wizard in downtown Chicago. The wizard tells you he can make you more attractive if you pay him money. When you ask how this process works, the wizard points to a random person on the street. You look at this random stranger. The wizard says, “I will now make them a dollar more attractive.” He waves his magic wand. Ostensibly, this person does not change at all; as far as you can tell, nothing is different. But—somehow—this person is suddenly a little more appealing. The tangible difference is invisible to the naked eye, but you can’t deny that this person is vaguely sexier. This wizard has a weird rule, though—you can only pay him once. You can’t keep giving him money until you’re satisfied. You can only pay him one lump sum up front. How much cash do you give the wizard?</li>
<li>Every person you have ever slept with is invited to a banquet where you are the guest of honor. No one will be in attendance except you, the collection of your former lovers, and the catering service. After the meal, you are asked to give a fifteen-minute speech to the assembly. What do you talk about?</li>
<li>For reasons that cannot be explained, cats can suddenly read at a twelfth-grade level. They can’t talk and they can’t write, but they can read silently and understand the text. Many cats love this new skill, because they now have something to do all day while they lay around the house; however, a few cats become depressed, because reading forces them to realize the limitations of their existence (not to mention the utter frustration of being unable to express themselves). This being the case, do you think the average cat would enjoy Garfield, or would cats find this cartoon to be an insulting caricature? 15.You have a brain tumor. Though there is no discomfort at the moment, this tumor would unquestionably kill you in six months. However, your life can (and will) be saved by an operation; the only downside is that there will be a brutal incision to your frontal lobe. After the surgery, you will be significantly less intelligent. You will still be a fully functioning adult, but you will be less logical, you will have a terrible memory, and you will have little ability to understand complex concepts or difficult ideas. The surgery is in two weeks. How do you spend the next fourteen days?</li>
<li>Someone builds and optical portal that allows you to see a vision of your own life in the future (it’s essentially a crystal ball that shows a randomly selected image of what your life will be like in twenty years). You can only see into this portal for thirty seconds. When you finally peer into the crystal, you see yourself in a living room, two decades older than you are today. You are watching a Canadian football game, and you are extremely happy. You are wearing a CFL jersey. Your chair is surrounded by books and magazines that promote the Canadian Football League, and there are CFL pennants covering your walls. You are alone in the room, but you are gleefully muttering about historical moments in Canadian football history. It becomes clear that—for some unknown reason—you have become obsessed with Canadian football. And this future is static and absolute; no matter what you do, this future will happen. The optical portal is never wrong. This destiny cannot be changed. The next day, you are flipping through television channels and randomly come across a pre-season CFL game between the Toronto Argonauts and the Saskatchewan Roughriders. Knowing your inevitable future, do you now watch it?</li>
<li>You are sitting in an empty bar (in a town you’ve never before visited), drinking Bacardi with a soft-spoken acquaintance you barely know. After an hour, a third individual walks into the tavern and sits by himself, and you ask your acquaintance who the new man is. “Be careful of that guy,” you are told. “He is a man with a past.” A few minutes later, a fourth person enters the bar; he also sits alone. You ask your acquaintance who this new individual is. “Be careful of that guy, too,” he says. “He is a man with no past.” Which of these two people do you trust less?</li>
<li>You have won a prize. The prize has two options, and you can choose either (but not both). The first option is a year in Europe with a monthly stipend of $2,000. The second option is ten minutes on the moon. Which option do you select?</li>
<li>Your best friend is taking a nap on the floor of your living room. Suddenly, you are faced with a bizarre existential problem: This friend is going to die unless you kick them (as hard as you can) in the rib cage. If you don’t kick them while they slumber, they will never wake up. However, you can never explain this to your friend; if you later inform them that you did this to save their life, they will also die from that. So you have to kick a sleeping friend in the ribs, and you can’t tell them why. Since you cannot tell your friend the truth, what excuse will you fabricate to explain this (seemingly inexplicable) attack?</li>
<li>For whatever the reason, two unauthorized movies are made about your life. The first is an independently released documentary, primarily comprised of interviews with people who know you and bootleg footage from your actual life. Critics are describing the documentary as “brutally honest and relentlessly fair.” Meanwhile, Columbia Tri-Star has produced a big-budget biopic of your life, casting major Hollywood stars as you and all your acquaintances; though the movie is based on actual events, screenwriters have taken some liberties with the facts. Critics are split on the artistic merits of this fictionalized account, but audiences love it. Which film would you be most interested in seeing?</li>
<li>Imagine you could go back to the age of five and relive the rest of your life, knowing everything that you know now. You will reexperience your entire adolescence with both the cognitive ability of an adult and the memories of everything you’ve learned form having lived your life previously. Would you lose your virginity earlier or later than you did the first time around (and by how many years)?</li>
<li>You work in an office. Generally, you are popular with your coworkers. However, you discover that there are currently two rumors circulating the office gossip mill, and both involve you. The first rumor is that you got drunk at the office holiday party and had sex with one of your married coworkers. This rumor is completely true, but most people don’t believe it. The second rumor is that you have been stealing hundreds of dollars of office supplies (and then selling them to cover a gambling debt). This rumor is completely false, but virtually everyone assumes it is factual. Which of these two rumors is most troubling to you?</li>
<li>Consider this possibility:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li>Think about deceased TV star John Ritter.</li>
<li>Now, pretend Ritter had never become famous. Pretend he was never affected by the trappings of fame, and try to imagine what his personality would have been like.</li>
<li>Now, imagine that this person—the unfamous John Ritter—is a character in a situation comedy.</li>
<li>Now, you are also a character in this sitcom, and the unfamous John Ritter character is your sitcom father.</li>
<li>However, this sitcom is actually your real life. In other words, you are living inside a sitcom: Everything about our life is a construction, featuring the unfamous John Ritter playing himself (in the role of your TV father). But this is not a sitcom. This is your real life. How would you feel about this?</li>

<section id="improv" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="improv">🎬 Improv</h2>
<p>Improv principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yes, and</strong> - follow along with suggestions people give to build a shared reality; don’t be a buzzkill. People tend to say no out of uncertainty, but “yes, and” gives a moment to pause, listen, and create something new.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace mistakes</strong> - find humor in the situation and run with it; don’t get caught up in shame and embarrassment. Ask “is this really the end of the world?”, and typically, it’s not.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t shy away from yourself</strong> - don’t feel pressured to act a certain way and be more “generic”; just be yourself and trust people will connect to specific parts of your identity.</li>
<li><strong>Be present in your body</strong> - Be aware of your body and stay in the present moment (clenched jaw, tensed shoulders).</li>
<li><strong>Make room for play</strong> - Embrace silliness, even if it feels selfish and unproductive to do so</li>
</ul>
<p>Improv games:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Red ball</strong> - people start throwing invisible balls around via eye contact and then chaos ensues</li>
<li><strong>Ancient proverb</strong> - everyone says one word around in a circle and tries to make it a hokey spiritual saying, when complete everyone says “om” and prays.</li>
<li><strong>I Need 3 Things</strong> - turn to person on right, say three things you need, next person must start first thing with your last thing you said</li>
<li><strong>Hitchhiker</strong> - driver is in a car in specific persona. Hitchhiker shows up with thumb up and joins car with new persona, and rest of the car adapts. Car fills up to 4 and then when the 5th hitchhiker shows up the driver makes an excuse to leave and everyone shifts</li>
<li><strong>A-B-A</strong> - person A says line to start scene, person B reacts, person A finishes scene</li>
<li><strong>Sync</strong> - think of a word and two words that can be used to describe that word (can’t have part of the word in it, hyphens, or other obvious tells)</li>
<li><strong>Gibberish</strong> - two people act out a scene in a non-specific location (ex: on a boat) talking in gibberish, and two other people translate what is happening in the scene</li>
<li><strong>Hero/Villain</strong> - in a larger group of people, choose one person to be a hero and another to be the villain. Your goal is to protect the hero from the villain by staying in between them. Variation on this game is to stay equidistant from both</li>
<li><strong>Freeze</strong> - everyone in a group walks around at random, freezing when one person stops moving, and only restarting once everyone has stopped. Variation includes jumping when another person jumps.</li>

</ul>
<p>Don’t:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan what you’re going to say next</li>
<li>Offer unsolicited advice or “fix” things</li>
<li>Split focus between speaker and something else</li>

<p>Three approaches; here is approach 1:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Ask if someone is interested in discussing the issue, and establish rapport.</li>
<li>Ask how strongly they feel about the issue on a scale of 1-10.</li>
<li>Share a story about someone affected by the issue (whether it’s you or a third party doesn’t seem to matter).</li>
<li>Ask for a number rating again.</li>
<li>Ask why the number feels right to them.</li>
<li>Repeat their reasoning back in their own words, ask if that sounds right, repeat until they are satisfied.</li>
<li>Ask if there was a time before they felt that way, and if so, how did they arrive at their current position?</li>
<li>Listen, summarize, repeat.</li>
<li>Briefly share your personal story about how you reached your position, without arguing.</li>
<li>Ask for a final rating and wrap up.</li>
</ol>
<p>Approach 2 (street epistemology):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Establish rapport, ask for consent to explore the person’s reasoning.</li>
<li>Ask them for a factual claim.</li>
<li>Repeat back in your own words until they’re satisfied with your summary.</li>
<li>Clarify their definitions, and use their definitions, not yours.</li>
<li>Ask for a numerical rating of their confidence in the claim.</li>
<li>Ask why they hold that level of confidence.</li>
<li>Ask what method they’ve used to judge the quality of their reasons, and focus the conversation on exploring their method.</li>
<li>Listen, summarize, repeat.</li>
<li>Wrap up.</li>

<p>Approach 3:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Build rapport, ask for consent to explore the person’s reasoning.</li>
<li>Ask where the person is on the issue on a scale of 1-10.</li>
<li>If they’re at 1, ask: why would other people be higher on the scale? If above 1, ask: why not lower?</li>

<h1>Maladaptive Relationship Strategies</h1>
<section id="avoidance-counterdependency" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="avoidance-counterdependency">🐺 Avoidance / Counterdependency</h2>
<p>Can also be known as fear of intimacy or an avoidant attachment style. A counterdependent person keeps people at an emotional distance. They require a lot of time and space to themselves and are extremely independent. Can inadvertently push people away when they become close to someone else as vulnerability terrifies them.</p>
<p>Types of avoidance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overt avoidance</strong> - people don’t show up to events because they are too uncomfortable.
<ul>
<li>When people invite you out, and you don’t show up, they’re less likely to invite you out again; they don’t know you might be anxious and instead will take your actions to mean that you’re not interested in them (people assume rejection easily, we’ve found).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Covert avoidance</strong> - showing up physically but checking out mentally. It is getting to the event but failing to engage with others, not making eye contact, talking really fast, and/or messing with your phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Signs of avoidance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Over-intellectualization</strong>
<ul>
<li>Left-brain oriented (very logical)</li>
<li>Lack of interoception, chronic muscle tension</li>
<li>Over-rely on self-regulation (routines, things, or activities) and under-rely on co-regulation</li>
<li>Processing emotions is less important than understanding why things happen the way they did</li>
<li>Difficulty recognizing personal needs and self-regulating emotions</li>
<li>Push away feeling with humor and disguise self-hatred with self-deprecating humor</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Social difficulties</strong>
<ul>
<li>Constant feelings of loneliness; isolated sense of self</li>
<li>Might have different personalities for different people to avoid being “seen”</li>
<li>Difficulty with eye contact</li>
<li>Perfectionistic tendencies, high standards, hard on themselves</li>
<li>Overwhelming need to be “seen”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Emotionally distant</strong>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty being vulnerable, and quickly feeling overwhelmed when people are vulnerable</li>
<li>Inability to ask for help, and discomfort accepting help from others</li>
<li>Disinterest in the lives of others</li>
<li>Preference for doing things yourself</li>
<li>Get low rewards from and expect very little from relationships</li>
<li>Emotionally regulate by themselves and not with others; tends to be autoregulating (more zoning/tuning out to dissociate from internal state than tuning into and working with internal state)</li>
<li>Fearful of being close to others; pushing people away when things become too serious</li>
<li>Deactivation - strong emotional charge causes a person to withdraw or shutdown from relationships. Done as a way to stay safe and avoid further hurt. Triggers thoughts like “I shouldn’t be here” or “This person doesn’t care for me”.</li>
<li>Faux vulnerability - sharing facts of a situation but not their thoughts or feelings.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Causes of avoidance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Isolation - being left alone a lot in childhood, limited face to face time with caregivers</li>
<li>Lack of Presence - caregivers aren’t present enough; even if physically present they may not be emotionally and psychologically present</li>
<li>Task-Based Presence - caregivers present only when teaching them something. Kids inherit belief of “I’m here for you, but only if you’re practical or functional.”</li>
<li>Absence of Touch - lack of touch in childhood from caregivers leads to “skin hunger” and avoidant tendencies</li>
<li>Emotional Neglect - consistent nonresponsiveness to emotional needs from caregivers; see Jonice Webb’s work for more</li>
<li>Expressive Dissonance - caregiver’s body language doesn’t match emotions, causing kids to have difficulty understanding and sending appropriate social cues</li>
<li>Disrupted Engagement - either child or caregiver do not have secure attachment stimulated</li>
<li>Rejection - being outright rejected by caregivers in some form</li>
</ul>
<p>Needs of an avoidant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower emotional demand; fear of being emotionally smothered
<ul>
<li>Consistency, safety, kindness, support, freedom</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Analytical stimulation</li>
<li>Constant learning</li>
<li>Validation and feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>Manage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Growth
<ul>
<li>Relax boundaries with people that are safe</li>
<li>Practice sharing details of your life with others</li>
<li>Tell people how they made you feel, articulate feelings and needs</li>
<li>Ask for help, and accept help if someone offers</li>
<li>Become more dependent and let people in more</li>
<li>Focus on others</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strategies
<ul>
<li>Create a daily ritual of checking in on your feelings, whether it be through journaling, meditation, or socializing.</li>
<li>Explore body-based movements like yoga</li>
<li>Remember emotions are temporary; be with your breath when they are intense</li>
<li>Practice compassion for childhood self and accept flaws as an adult</li>
<li>Create meaningful self-narrative
<ul>
<li>Release from self-imposed prison - what do you need to do to earn self-respect so you can stop tormenting yourself?</li>

<h1>Adaptive Relationship Strategies</h1>
<section id="boundaries" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="boundaries">🧱 Boundaries</h2>
<p>A boundary is an imaginary line that separates me from you. It separates your physical space, your feelings, needs, and responsibilities from others. Your boundaries also tell other people how they can treat you – what’s acceptable and what isn’t. Without boundaries, people may take advantage of you because you haven’t set limits about how you expect to be treated.</p>
<p>Boundaries can be overly rigid or overly porous; additionally, they can be rigid in one area while porous in another. Either way, when you ignore boundaries you set with others, others think they can safely ignore your boundaries. Even though there are consequences to setting boundaries they are critical for maintaining self-respect.</p>
<p>Types of boundaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical boundaries</li>
<li>Mental boundaries</li>
<li>Resource boundaries</li>
<li>Individualistic boundaries</li>
<li>Communal boundaries</li>
</ul>
<p>Good boundaries to set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritize what keeps you happy, healthy, and sane.</li>
<li>Say no to stuff that doesn’t interest you</li>
<li>Let calls go to voicemail</li>
<li>Wait before responding to a call, text, or email</li>
<li>Inform people of a decision rather than ask for permission</li>
<li>Take mental health days as needed</li>
<li>Have time-boxed hangouts for people that are good in small doses only, and limit settings for hanging out otherwise</li>
<li>Block people that really bother you</li>
<li>Point out when people do things you like and also things that hurt you</li>
<li>Don’t engage in topics you don’t like</li>
<li>Ask for help setting boundaries, and discuss boundaries and expectations otherwise</li>
<li>Don’t share parts of your life with people you don’t want to be close to</li>
<li>You are not required to say yes to every social opportunity, especially if you are dreading it.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to better set boundaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set boundaries earlier in a relationship rather than later, and stringent boundaries are easier to loosen than looser boundaries are to tighten</li>
<li>Use the emotional bandwidth (scale of 1-10) to indicate what level of communication you can handle (mindless to heavy in terms of content)</li>
<li>You are not responsible for your parents’ emotional wellbeing. They are independent adults who have been on this earth for many more years than you.</li>
<li>“You don’t attract the wrong people, you’re just not good at filtering out the people who aren’t good for you. It’s ok to say no.”</li>
<li>“Why do you make people more comfortable when you are uncomfortable” (people pleasing and fawning)
<ul>
<li>Related - “don’t set yourself on fire to keep others warm”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“why are you giving your power away?”</li>
<li>People pleasing should be thought of as self-abandonment</li>
<li>“There is a difference between being kind and being a doormat.”</li>
<li>Translate negative self-talk to understand what it’s really trying to tell you</li>
<li>“When you let someone break your boundaries over and over again, it wasn’t them breaking your boundaries anymore. It was you breaking your boundaries.”</li>
<li>Having beliefs about relationships like:
<ul>
<li>Feeling safe saying no to others</li>
<li>Meeting your own needs if others say no to you</li>
<li>Having a strong sense of self/identity</li>
<li>Respecting yourself</li>
<li>Treating others with respect</li>
<li>Not compromising who you are to avoid rejection</li>
<li>Feeling safe asking for help and space when needed</li>
<li>Being in charge of your emotions and happiness, and letting others be responsible for theirs</li>
<li>Taking responsibility for your failures and mistakes</li>
<li>Knowing feelings and needs, and feeling safe communicating feelings and needs to others</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="conflict-management" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conflict-management">💥 Conflict Management</h2>
<p>Strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a clear goal for the conversation, so everyone knows what success looks like</li>
<li>Maintain a neutral voice. Do not get angry or full of contempt; try to stay relaxed</li>
<li>Complicate the narrative; in this society the issue is rarely simple or black and white</li>
<li>Conflicts should be addressed thoughtfully, seeking mutual understanding and resolution (don’t just avoid the issue).</li>
<li>Watch out for anger of hope (constructive, helps resolving conflicts) vs anger of despair (destructive and harms relationships)</li>
<li>“If you don’t have these problems with any other person in your life, why do you think you’re the problematic person in this one?”</li>
<li>Some of my long lasting behaviors that tend to pop up when I’m under extreme distress that I feel ashamed of were once the only ways to protect myself. My therapist suggested when I feel those patterns kick in to thank myself for trying to protect myself. Almost instantly reduces a lot of the shame. Then I’m able to think more clearly and actually use other techniques I’ve learned.</li>

<li>No unstable and untreated mental illness</li>
<li>Don’t optimize for prom date, but life partner</li>
<li>Look for those who are kind, loyal, reliable, growth mindset, good communicator, emotionally stable, and respectful of others, including

<ul>
<li>Low to average neuroticism - high neuroticism leads to conflict</li>

<p><strong>Using Dating Apps</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>We think we know what we want, but we’re wrong. Apps will allow filtering great matches</li>
<li>Apps promote “relationshopping”, searching for relationships like online shopping</li>
<li>Apps make us more indecisive about whom to date</li>
<li>When we see only a rough sketch of someone, we fill in the gaps with flattering details, leading to disappointment as the person is not the fantasy</li>
</ul>

<section id="meeting-and-befriending-new-people" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="meeting-and-befriending-new-people">👋 Meeting and Befriending New People</h2>
<p>In general, to develop fulfilling relationships, you will want the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genuine positive regard - the other person likes you for who you are</li>
<li>Self-disclosure - feeling freedom to discuss personal topics</li>
<li>Instrumental aid - willingness to provide tangible support</li>
<li>Similarity - seeing the world in a like-minded way</li>
<li>Enjoyment - having fun in each other’s company</li>
<li>Agency - friends that can help you find a job or offer a summer home to stay in</li>
</ul>
<p>Women tend to expect more of their friends in the realms of positive regard and self-disclosure, whereas men tend to expect slightly more by way of agency. However, people generally don’t explain what they expect in their friendships.</p>
<p>Things you’ll want to look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone you don’t have to pretend or fawn for; related, the ability to disagree</li>
<li>A willingness to stick around when things aren’t perfect</li>
<li>Respect</li>
<li>Feeling energized after hanging out</li>
<li>Bring out the fun side and doing so because you want to, not out of fear</li>

<li>Who you’d like to be closer with but are afraid they wouldn’t be interested</li>
<li>Who has high upside to be a good friend if the effort is put in</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Message someone you regularly interact with online</li>
<li>Message people online (90% of such is just reaching out in like-minded spaces where you can send DMs) with cold messages:
<ul>
<li>“Hi, I think the work you’re doing is really cool. [Here’s what resonates with me and how it’s connected to my experience.] Also, I’d love to have a quick coffee date if you ever have time and would like to connect. No worries either way. Keep it up and let me know if there’s ever any way I can support you.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write to a mutual friend you’ve always thought you’d get along with</li>
<li>Put more effort into current friendships, or reconnect with decayed friendships</li>
<li>Invite friends’ significant others to events or ask them to invite a friend of a friend along</li>
<li>Encourage yourself to make/keep friends even when being alone feels like a better plan</li>

<ul>
<li>Meetup</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Local church</li>
<li>Identify new activities or topics you want to pursue
<ul>
<li>If it’s a hobby you’re tangentially interested in, go once or twice to see if you like it, but don’t make yourself go if you hate it (ie, golf)</li>
<li>If it’s a hobby you know you like, put in a lot of effort to get involved</li>
<li>If a group isn’t around, start a group</li>
<li>Host group gatherings with new friends</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Go to events
<ul>
<li>How likely is it that I’ll interact with a person at an event?</li>
<li>How likely is it that I’ll enjoy myself at this event?</li>
<li>Ex: go to shows or restaurants alone</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Find a third place, which:
<ul>
<li>Is separate from the workplace and the home</li>
<li>Is on neutral ground (no incentive to stay)</li>
<li>Leveling place (anyone is welcome, accessible and accommodating)</li>
<li>Conversation that is lighthearted is the main activity</li>
<li>Has to be low-profile / not require spending lots of money</li>

<li>Seek more rejection, not less</li>
<li>Be more selective in friendships
<ul>
<li>“There’s nothing wrong with you, you are just picking the wrong people to be friends with”</li>
<li>“Conversations aren’t all dependent on you. There’s at least one other person participating.”</li>
<li>Maintaining a relationship with certain people would be a service project. That I could do it if I wanted, but with the knowledge that it would be work and I wouldn’t be able to expect reciprocity. And not to take on too many service projects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Drop expectations of others, focus on giving to others without reciprocity
<ul>
<li>Related: Act on values, not perception of closeness; thinking “sometimes people are just not being good friends to me and don’t care about me as much as I care about them” helps nothing</li>

<ul>
<li>Be vulnerable first; don’t wait for the other person</li>

<ul>
<li>Others won’t judge you for your vulnerability as much as you think, and you might be perceived positively for doing so</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tell others when you want to be friends with them</li>
<li>Avoid oversharing/emotional dumping, as that can push others away and cause you harm. Similarly, don’t keep being authentic with those that treat you poorly for doing so</li>
<li>Don’t feel like you need to become someone else to be liked; faking it is draining, and at its core it’s a manipulative and inauthentic approach</li>
<li>Offer emotional bids to signal that you want attention and connection; central to all types of relationships</li>

<li>Look for win-wins in generosity</li>
<li>Understand the level of reciprocity in the relationship, and do not engage in mutuality where there is a major imbalance (ie, if you’re always reaching out, asking for support, or the only one being vulnerable)</li>
<li>What you give and expect to receive should be proportional to the depth of the friendship</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>Give gifts (baking, cards, money, gifts, etc)</li>
<li>Offer to do errands (chores, drive to airport, exercise, etc) or borrow objects</li>

<p>Psychological safety is the shared belief that a team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. It’s about creating an environment where people feel comfortable expressing themselves, asking questions, and making mistakes without fear of punishment or humiliation.</p>
<p>A related concept is creative interchange, which is a process where individuals or groups share ideas, perspectives, and experiences to foster innovation, understanding, and growth. It’s like a brainstorming session where everyone’s input is valued and can lead to new insights or solutions.</p>

<li>Nurturing three close relationships. Here, Killam is talking about maintaining the tightest bonds in your life, usually with family and dear friends.</li>
<li>Aiming for one hour of social interaction a day. “That doesn’t have to be all at once. It could be 10 minutes here, 10 minutes there,” Killam clarifies to BI. And feel free to combine your hanging out time with errands or other activities if you’re busy.</li>

<section id="secure-attachment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="secure-attachment">🧷 Secure Attachment</h2>
<p>Attachment theory is an imperfect measure of relationship quality (see <a href="https://www.fatherly.com/health/attachment-theory-wrong-attachment-styles-dont-matter">here</a>), but can be useful as a general framework.</p>
<p>People with secure attachment tend to be consistent, available, reliable, responsive, and predictable. They generally have high self-esteem, good emotional regulation skills, and good self-development capabilities.</p>
<p>Experiences they generally had as a child involve consistency and reliability, but specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sense of felt safety, promoted by parents’ consistent and reliable protection of the child from danger and threat</li>
<li>A sense of being seen and known, promoted by parents’ consistent, reliable, and accurate attunement to the child</li>
<li>Experience of felt comfort, promoted by consistent, reliable, and timely soothing and reassurance</li>
<li>Being valued, promoted by parents’ consistent, reliable, and clear expressed delight in the child</li>
<li>Support for being and becoming one’s unique, best self, promoted by parents’ consistent, reliable, unconditional support and encouragement for exploration</li>
</ul>
<p>Those of us who did not experience a securely attached childhood or who have had significant attachment insecurity from our adult relationships can still develop earned secure attachment. This can be done by making sense of your story and understanding why you did what you did to survive growing up.</p>
<p>Secure attachment with others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being present with others
<ul>
<li>Put smartphone down when together</li>
<li>Prioritize regular time with partners</li>
<li>Communicate availability</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Express why someone is special and valuable
<ul>
<li>Flash partner the eyes</li>
<li>Practice gratitude with partner and how they are special in spoken and/or written word</li>
<li>Do activities together</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Emotionally attune to them
<ul>
<li>Active listening, reflect back what you’ve heard</li>
<li>Bring bodies into attunement</li>
<li>Ask genuinely how they’re doing with genuine curiosity and a desire to truly understand, not to confirm existing beliefs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Have rituals and routines to support the relationship
<ul>
<li>Have bedtime or waking rituals</li>
<li>Create standing dates and dedicate time to regular activities together</li>
<li>Celebrate birthdays, holidays, and anniversaries together</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Involves handling conflict and being able to rupture/repair well
<ul>
<li>Take a time-out if things get too heated</li>
<li>Don’t fight over text and wait until it can be done in-person or through voice</li>
<li>Keep desire to be right in check</li>
</ul></li>
