## 😎 Assertiveness

Assertiveness is communicating and expressing your thoughts, feelings, and opinions in a way that makes your views and needs clearly understood by others, without putting down their thoughts, feelings, or opinions. Assertiveness is the ability to express our thoughts and feelings openly in an Honest, Appropriate, Respectful and Direct way. It can be HARD to do, but it gets easier with practice. In assertive communication both individuals are considered to be equally important.

Signs of assertiveness:

* Having dignity and self-respect
* Saying NO when justified without feeling guilty
* Expressing your feelings
* Asking for what you want directly
* Feeling good about yourself
* Being able to change your mind
* Negotiating and reaching compromises when conflict exists
* Being able to make mistakes
* Ability to ask for help
  * 1 to 2 sentence summary of the situation
  * Show how you've taken responsibility for the situation
  * Be very specific with your ask for help (one or two things at most)
  * Can do it this way: I’m new at X, can you help me?

## 👂 Listening

Do:

* Be attentive and tune into what the other person is saying; use short verbal affirmations and nonverbal cues (nod, smile, maintain eye contact, avoiding distractions) to do this
* Stay curious
* Make understanding a goal
* Confirm what you heard with the speaker to see if you got it right; paraphrasing is a good way to do this
* Repair if you interrupt, get distracted, become defensive, or misunderstand
* Ask clarifying, specific, and/or open ended questions
* Be aware of how much time you spend talking in the conversation
* Inhabit the role of a passenger on the speaker's train of thought
* Recall previously shared information and share similar experiences when appropriate
* 

Don't:

* Plan what you're going to say next
* Offer unsolicited advice or "fix" things
* Split focus between speaker and something else
* Try to finish or anticipate what the speaker is saying
* Take what the other person is saying personally and become defensive
* Completely shut down your own reaction
* Mind-reading
* Filtering and ignoring what's not relevant
* Judging other person's actions
* Daydreaming
* Debating and Arguing
* Insistence on being right
* Derailing when the topic is uncomfortable
Placating immediately to other person's needs


## 🤝 Negotiation

### Ackerman Negotiation Technique

* Set your target price (your goal).
* Set your first offer at 65 percent of your target price.
* Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent).
* Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying “No” to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer.
* When calculating the final amount, use precise, nonround numbers like, say, 37,893 rather than 38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight.
* On your final number, throw in a nonmonetary item (that they probably don’t want) to show you’re at your limit.

## Persuasion

* Reciprocity
  * Present a small gift before asking a request
	* Offer ludicrous request, then offer a more reasonable one (rejection-then-retreat tactic)
* Commitment/Consistency
	* Make decisions for a reason; not reasons for a decision
* Social proof
	* Deciding what's correct based on what others think is correct
	* Why do you do something regardless of everyone else doing it?
* Liking
	* More likely to comply with requests from people we like than those we don't know/dislike
* Authority 
	* Comply with requests from authority
	* Assess authority figure's credentials and relevance of credentials
* Scarcity
	* Finding things more appealing with limited availability - loss aversion
  * Want things because of their intrinsic value, not because of their rarity or status

# Maladaptive Communication

## Co-Rumination

When people talk together about their problems, how bad those problems are, why they’re occurring, and how terrible it’s making them feel.
* people sometimes overestimate how much their friends want to be dwelling on the negative
* Co-rumination is so socially reinforcing, but may actually weaken our emotion regulation capacity
* Is unusual for its apparent positive features, such as boosting intimacy with others

If you find yourself ruminating a lot on your own after seeing a certain person, that could be another sign that the relationship is getting co-rumination heavy

* Finding solutions for people instead of allowing them to find answers on their own 
* Offering money and resources when you can’t do so comfortably 
* Preventing people from enduring the consequences of their actions 
* Not setting boundaries around how to help others

## Victimization

* Don’t make excuses for things that you can control. 
* Decide to move forward despite what happened. 
* Let go of grudges. 
* Acknowledge that you aren’t perfect. 
* Explore what you’ve learned. 
* Practice assertiveness. 
* Stop comparing yourself with others. 
* Identify ways that you can better care for yourself. 
* Understand your feelings, and learn to express them. 
* Minimize or eliminate self-pity (it will keep you stuck).

# Adaptive Relationship Strategies

## 🧱 Boundaries

* You are not responsible for your parents' emotional wellbeing. They are independent adults who have been on this earth for many more years than you.
* “You don’t attract the wrong people, you’re just not good at filtering out the people who aren’t good for you. It’s ok to say no.”
* “Why do you make people more comfortable when you are uncomfortable” (people pleasing and fawning)
  * Related - "don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm"
* "why are you giving your power away?"
* People pleasing should be thought of as self-abandonment
* “There is a difference between being kind and being a doormat.”
* Translate negative self-talk to understand what it's really trying to tell you

## 💥 Conflict Management

## 👋 Meeting and Befriending New People

### Identify Limiting Beliefs

  * Some variation of "My situation won't allow this":
    * "I live in a rural town and there is no way that I can ever get social support, and I’m doomed to feel alone forever."
    * "This community won't accept me because I'm not X enough"
    * "I missed my chance to find my people since I'm no longer in college/working in an office/etc"
  * Some variation of "I'm not needed/a priority":
    * "They already have enough friends"
	* "I'm just a friendship of convenience"
	* "Online friends aren't real friends."
  * Some variation of "I'm not good enough":
    * "I don't belong here."
    * "I don't deserve friendships, I deserve abuse"
    * “If I’m not one hundred percent certain this person will accept and love me, I can’t take the risk to build trust with them.”
    
### Take Initiative and Reach Out to Others

* Go through list of contacts, determine when last in touch and reach out to:
  * Those you haven't talked to in a long time but used to get along well with
  * Who you'd like to be closer with but are afraid they wouldn't be interested
  * Who has high upside to be a good friend if the effort is put in
* Message someone you regularly interact with online
* Message people online (90% of such is just reaching out in like-minded spaces where you can send DMs) with cold messages:
  * “Hi, I think the work you’re doing is really cool. [Here’s what resonates with me and how it’s connected to my experience.] Also, I’d love to have a quick coffee date if you ever have time and would like to connect. No worries either way. Keep it up and let me know if there’s ever any way I can support you.”
* Write to a mutual friend you've always thought you'd get along with
* Put more effort into current friendships, or reconnect with decayed friendships
* Invite friends' significant others to events or ask them to invite a friend of a friend along
* Encourage yourself to make/keep friends even when being alone feels like a better plan
* After you have a chance to get to know someone a little, saying something like, “I’ve really enjoyed talking to you. I’m trying to build my friend network and I think you’re great and would love to hang out sometime. Would you be into that?” 

### Join Groups and Attend Events

* Join groups
  * Meetup
  * Classes
  * Local church
  * Identify new activities or topics you want to pursue
    * If it's a hobby you're tangentially interested in, go once or twice to see if you like it, but don't make yourself go if you hate it (ie, golf)
    * If it's a hobby you know you like, put in a lot of effort to get involved
    * If a group isn't around, start a group
    * Host group gatherings with new friends
* Go to events
  * How likely is it that I'll interact with a person at an event?
  * How likely is it that I'll enjoy myself at this event?
  * Ex: go to shows or restaurants alone
* Find a third place, which:
  * Is separate from the workplace and the home
  * Is on neutral ground (no incentive to stay)
  * Leveling place (anyone is welcome, accessible and accommodating)
  * Conversation that is lighthearted is the main activity
  * Has to be low-profile / not require spending lots of money
  * Examples:
    * Bars/pubs/taverns
    * Cafes/coffee shops
    * Parks
    * Bookshops
    * FLGS
    * Churches
    * Libraries
    * Community centers
    * Malls
    * Recreation centers
* Focus on yourself first (fill your life with play and pursue your own goals and interests)
* Seek more rejection, not less
* Be more selective in friendships 
* Drop expectations of others, focus on giving to others without reciprocity

### Express Vulnerability and Authenticity

* Be vulnerable first; don't wait for the other person
* Be vulnerable first even if it's scary. Remember you're not practicing it because it's comfortable; you're doing it because it aligns with your values and highest self
  * Others won't judge you for your vulnerability as much as you think, and you might be perceived positively for doing so
* Tell others when you want to be friends with them
* Avoid oversharing, as that can push others away and cause you harm. Similarly, don't keep being authentic with those that treat you poorly for doing so
* Don't feel like you need to become someone else to be liked; faking it is draining, and at its core it's a manipulative and inauthentic approach

### Be Generous

## Psychological Safety

Psychological safety is the shared belief that a team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. It’s about creating an environment where people feel comfortable expressing themselves, asking questions, and making mistakes without fear of punishment or humiliation1.
