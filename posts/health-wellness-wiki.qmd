# Difficult Emotions

## üò° Anger

Anger is what we feel when something gets in the way of what we want or disrupts the way we think things are supposed to be. It's evolution's alarm bell, so listen to what it's telling you.

Anger helps you:

* Identify needs and set boundaries
* Drives you towards your goals
* Strengthens relationships
* Discharge tension from body
* Motivates you to solve problems and injustices
* Increases optimism and creativity

Common triggers:

* Cognitive distortions like overgeneralizing, catastrophizing, and mind-reading
* Feeling like you aren't being heard
* Feeling like decisions are made unfairly
* Being anxious
* Being told to calm down
* Being interrupted mid-sentence
* Being impacted by actions without having permission
* When you're about to do something and someone tells you to do it

Managing:

* Be aware of your anger triggers and review on a regular basis. Avoid triggers when it makes sense
* Take a time-out and remove yourself from the situation; plan a time-out strategy in advance
* Know the warning signs for anger
  * Raised voice
  * Verbal insults and becoming argumentative
  * Feeling sick to stomach
  * Headaches
  * Sweating and feeling hot
  * Clenched fists or jaw

  * Clean up clutter
  * Listen to calming music
  * Play a game
  * Call a friend
  * Draw or paint

  * Punch a pillow
  * Scream in a car or into a pillow
  * Throw ice cubes in shower
  * Go to a rage room
  * Exercise or dance
* Keep an anger journal and reflect on emotional state prior to anger outburst, facts of the situation, what you were feeling when expressing anger
  * Pinpoint the needs underlying the emotion

### ‚õèÔ∏è Repressed Anger

*"People diagnosed with cancer or autoimmune disease, with chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia, or with potentially debilitating neurological conditions, are often enjoined to relax, to think positively, to lower their stress levels. All that is good advice, but impossible to carry out if one of the major sources is not clearly identified and dealt with: the internalization of anger." ‚Äì from ‚ÄòWhen The Body Says No ‚Äì The Cost of Hidden Stress‚Äô*

Repressed anger is often internalized emotional responses that were never expressed properly. It's dependent on cultural norms, but girls generally learn it is unacceptable to express anger at a young age.

Causes and triggers of repressed anger

* Having perfectionistic, people pleasing, intellectualizing, or neurotic tendencies
* Having a mental health condition or traumatic brain injury
* Using drugs or alcohol
* Being rejected for expressing anger in the past
* Low emotional intelligence
* High levels of shame

Signs of Repressed Anger

* Not feeling angry, but often feeling sad or depressed
* Overuse of sarcasm or cynicism
* Discomfort with conflict and confrontation
* Dependence on avoidance to cope
* Becoming defensive when accused of becoming angry
* Need to control many things in life
* Chronic muscle tension or headaches
* Discomfort when others share intimate emotions
* Passive-aggressiveness
* Difficulty setting boundaries, standing up for yourself, saying no
* Shutting down, avoiding people, or isolating when upset or in pain
* Being explosive when you are angry
* Complaining often when things don't go your way
* High levels of chronic stress or anxiety
* Frequent negative or self-critical thoughts
* Ignoring things that upset you rather than addressing them
* Feeling bitter, envious, resentful of others
* Feeling guilty, ashamed, or bad when you are angry

Consequences:

* Health issues (insomnia, high blood pressure, heart problems, etc)
* Mental health issues (anxiety, depression, addiction, etc)
* Poor relationships
* Numbness or apathy

Managing:

* Understand where anger is coming from
* Track anger in your body via physical sensations
* Journal
* Interrupt angry thoughts
* Find physical outlet for anger
* Meditate
* Use I-statements "I feel ___ when you ___."
* Feel your feelings

## üò∞ Anxiety

Note - I'm not considering feeling anxious as the same as something like Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). This is meant for more day to day anxiety people experience.

*"When you get anxious, your amygdala is activated. You can tell yourself that you're okay and even logically understand you are okay, but your amygdala isn't catching up yet. Just remember that you are okay, and it's just your amygdala needing time to adjust (10-15 minutes)."*

Anxiety, simply put, is concern about the unknown and/or future. It's feeling like we‚Äôre not in control ‚Äî we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen, so we imagine the worst.

Types of anxiety:

* Functional anxiety - gives important information to the brain
* Death anxiety - fear of death and dying
  * Fear of both the known and unknown
  * Coming close to death brings about growth and positive life transformation
  * Acceptance of death is not the same as giving up on life, but allows for meaning to be brought to life
* Performance anxiety - fear of faltering in front of others
* Social anxiety - fear of disapproval in social situations
  * Don't excessively monitor yourself as that gives the wrong impression to others; how you feel inside is not how you look to others
  * Remember spotlight effect - people are too self-absorbed to think about you
  * Don't tell yourself you have to perform perfectly, creates impossible standards
  * Don't use alcohol to treat social anxiety
  * Perceived inadequacies are not tied to a fundamental lack of social skills
  * For fear of missing out (FOMO):
    * Do a digital detox
    * Get more quality time in loved ones
    * Practice meditation and mindfulness
    * Journal

Manage:

* Is worrying *actually* helpful? If so, do it.
* Exposure therapy to reduce anxious feelings; don't avoid what you're afraid of. Escape and avoidance only offer short-term relief and feed anxiety in the long run
* Slower, deeper breaths
* Reframe cognitive distortions to be more realistic, threats as challenges to overcome, and treat anxiety as excitement
* Self-compassion
* Act in line with your values

## üëÄ Envy

Envy is not jealousy - they result from different situations, generate distinct appraisals, and produce distinctive emotional experiences. Envy typically involves two people and occurs when one lacks something enjoyed by the other. Envy occurs when we want something another person has and we don't feel like we can have it.

Envy helps you identify what you want in life.

* **Plain Envy** - don't want to take it away from someone
* **Malicious Envy** - want to take it away from someone

Reasons it happens:

* Poor self-efficacy (they don't believe that they can or they haven't proven to themselves that they can)
* Pessimistic messaging from others
* Lack of resources
* Social comparison leading to "compare and despair"

Managing:

* If you envy something you truly cannot have, practice radical acceptance
* If you envy someone else, remember this quote from Naval Ravikant:
  * *"One day, I realized with all these people I was envious of, I couldn‚Äôt just choose little aspects of their life. I couldn‚Äôt say I want his body, I want her money, I want his personality. You have to be that person. Do you want to actually be that person with all of their reactions, their desires, their family, their happiness level, their outlook on life, their self-image? If you‚Äôre not willing to do a wholesale, 24/7, 100 percent swap with who that person is, then there is no point in being envious."*


## üò¢ Feeling Depressed

Note - I'm not considering feeling depressed as the same as something like Major Depression Disorder (MDD). This is meant more for mild cases.

*"People in the depressive position are often stigmatized as 'failures' or 'losers'. Of course nothing could be further from the truth. If these people are in the depressive position it is because they tried too hard or taken on too much. So hard and so much that they have made themselves ill with depression. In other words, if these people are in the depressive position, it was simply because their world was not good enough for them. They wanted more. They wanted better. They wanted different, not just for themselves, but for all those around them. So if they are failures and losers, this is only because they set the bar far too high. They could have swept everything under the carpet and pretended as so many people do, that all is for the best and the best of possible worlds. However, unlike most people, they had the strength and the honesty to admit that something was amiss; to admit that something wasn't quite right. So rather than being failures or losers they are all the opposite. They are ambitious, they are truthful, they are courageous, and that is precisely why they became ill. To make them believe that they are suffering from some mental disorder, or some chemical imbalance in the brain, and that their recovery depends entirely or even mostly on popping pills is to do them and to do us an immense disfavor. It is to deny them the opportunity, not only to identify and address important life problems, but also to deny them the opportunity to develop a more refined perspective and a deeper understanding of themselves and of the world around them; and therefore, to deny them the opportunity to develop their highest potential as human beings."- Dr. Neel Burton*

Managing:

* Healthy habits (eat right, stay hydrated, exercise, meditate, 8 hours of sleep, be in nature, journal, etc)
* Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can be used to manage thought biases that are common when depressed - how we feel is not evidence that these thoughts are true
* Develop promotion goals (making good things happen) over prevention goals (avoiding bad things)
* Build strong social ties through volunteering or clubs if your social circle is weak
* Understand the beliefs associated with the Ideal Self (who you want to be), Actual Self (who you are), and the "Should Be" Self (what you feel you must do)

## üò≠ Grief

*As my grieving and recovery work progressed, I discovered why I was so intimacy-phobic: becoming intimate with another would (and eventually did) unlock the prodigious hunger of all my unmet needs for love. I was unconsciously terrified that if anyone began to meet those needs, I would begin to depend on them and end up needing them.*

Combines painful feelings of loss with a desire to get back what we lost, even if that‚Äôs impossible. Often triggered by endings of life, relationships, jobs. It's a normal and natural part of being human, and the pain can be both physical and emotional. Trying to block out or repress grief can cause further problems down the line.

5 stages of grief:

* Denial can help us survive the overwhelming pain of grief. As denial fades, this allows new waves of emotion to surface.
* When we experience anger about something we can‚Äôt control, using physical movement helps us to use the physiological arousal and bring the body back down to calm for a while.
* Ruminating over the What ifs can easily lead down a path of self-blame.
* Depression is a normal reaction after a bereavement.
* Acceptance is not the same as liking or agreeing with the situation.

Managing:

* Let the dead be dead - Give 30 minutes each day to experience and feel the grief at 100%, and then give yourself permission to be with the living
* The Spirit Never Dies - Talk to the loved one who has passed; say what you're grateful for and ask what they wish for you
* Practice mourning the loss by working through the pain, accepting the new reality, and not putting an expectation on how the process should go or how quickly you should be "done" with the process
* If grieving a loss in childhood:
  * Feelings of unfairness and resentment can arise, especially if the loss is great and requires many instances of grieving (can feel unending)
  * Practice these components:
    * Angering (Active)
    * Verbal ventilation (Active) - speaking or writing to release painful feelings in uncensored way
    * Crying (Active) - can bring catastrophizing to a halt
    * Feeling emotions throughout body in present moment, not resisting (Passive)

## üë§ Loneliness

*As I continued to grieve I was shocked to feel how profoundly lonely I was and had always been. I had been so sure that I didn‚Äôt need anybody. My tears revealed to me the awful misery of my loneliness. I was daunted by the realization that I had never spent a moment of true interpersonal comfort with anyone.*

Loneliness can be described in different ways; a commonly used measure of loneliness, the UCLA Loneliness Scale, asks individuals about a range of feelings or deficits of connection, including how often they feel: 
* they lack companionship
* left out
* "in tune" with people around them
* outgoing and friendly
* there are people they can turn to

Types of loneliness:

* **New-Situation Loneliness** - change in location, job, etc.
* **I'm Different Loneliness** - feeling fundamentally different from others
* **Intimate Loneliness** - lacking close relationships
* **Pet Loneliness** - lacking a pet
* **No Time for You Loneliness** - people who are friendly but don't want to, have time to, or don't want to prioritizing, becoming or maintaining a friendship
* **Relational (Casual Friends) Loneliness** - lacking depth and ability to confide/trust others
* **Quiet Presence Loneliness** - not having someone to hang out with at home to know they're "there" 

Signs of Loneliness:

* Oversharing when someone is listening
* Feeling disposable in a group
* Putting other people's needs above your own
* Feeling need to be overly helpful or nice
* Feeling isolated and like nobody sees you
* Feeling like you don't belong anywhere
* Becoming obsessive with friendships

Managing:

* Get a hold of it before it gets too bad if possible. The longer it stays intense the more your thinking will be corrupted
* Deepen emotional bonds with others
  * Face to face time with friends or family, ideally every day. If not, try for video or phone calls, with text as the last/worst option
  * Physically touch others
  * Host dinner parties or other social events
  * Become a great listener
* Be vulnerable and talk about loneliness with other people
  * Don't pursue negative relationships to fill the void
* Create opportunities for social connection
  * Join a group... but don't just join a group to "join a group", especially if you hate the content
  * Attend a park, local cafe, church, or other local space where you might come across others
  * If at an event, talk to a stranger for at least seven minutes to know if the conversation will be interesting
  * Trivial conversations help with loneliness
  * Be kind to strangers
  * Diversify your social portfolio, including coworkers, friends, family, and strangers
  * Do not overextend yourself socially, focus on several times a month at most, not every day (not as applicable for extroverts)
    * However, don't find poor excuses to turn down social events, including skipping a spontaneous event due to feeling "unprepared"
  * Be active, not passive online. This means participating in communities, chatting about topics you care about, give advice on forums, have video calls with friends, and share vulnerably online.
  * Respond reasonably when talking with others
    * Don't respond curtly or hog the conversation
    * Ask others about their lives and opinions
    * Don't confess your faults and insecurities to those you just met
* Practice healthy habits
  * Determine specific discomfort with being alone
  * Remember observability bias - you encounter solitude frequently, but never encounter other people's.
  * Give others benefit of the doubt, and don't take friendly ribbings too personally
  * Don't compare yourself to someone's highlight reel
  * Share good things when they happen in the present moment
  * Spend more time in nature and away from screens
  * Don't use defensive body language (folding arms over chest, hands in pocket, looking at phone)
* Adopt a pet
* Enjoy being alone
  * Pursue hobbies and things only you want to do
  * Take yourself out on a date and focus on things that your best days consisted of, what you stopped doing for no reason, and made hours fly by
  * Differentiate taking time for yourself (conscious choice) and self-isolation (driven by fear)
* Use nostalgia to give your life meaning again
  * Lonely people often feel like side characters in their own lives with a lack of meaning or direction; nostalgia can help to recenter the narrative

## üò≥ Shame

Shame is the feeling that you‚Äôre an inherently bad or flawed person. and thus unworthy of love/belonging and/or incapable of change. When we feel shame, we might believe that we‚Äôre unworthy of love or incapable of change. Effectively, shame is the gap between who we are (current self) and what we want and/or believe we should be (ideal self), and needs shame, secrecy, and judgment to thrive.

# Maladaptive Mindsets

## Control

Can show up in a variety of ways across all the domains of life and is generally done out of fear in order to feel safe. Examples of the control being maladaptive:

* Eating disorders
* Financial rigidity through FIRE
* Excessive tidiness and cleanliness
* Unending personal development and growth
  * *Why do we have to grow and excel all the time? Why does failure require constant rehabilitation? Why can‚Äôt we just let it be exactly what it is ‚Äì a normal and natural part of our mortal existence? To put it bluntly, the growth mindset purports to celebrate failure when in actual fact it does completely the opposite.*

This level of control can be a means to reduce feelings of inferiority and shame.

## Perfectionism

Defense mechanism to cope with emotional neglect and also is about safety. 

Three main types of perfectionism:

* **Self-Oriented Perfectionism** - I must be perfect (or meet an exceptionally high standard) in order to be worthy of love and respect
* **Socially Prescribed Perfectionism** - Others expect me to be perfect (or meet an exceptionally high standard) in order to be worthy of love and respect
* **Other-Oriented Perfectionism** - Other people must be perfect (or meet exceptionally high standards) in order to be worthy of love and respect

Examples:

* Treating benign statements as jabs at perceived imperfections
* Intensely critical and an absence of self-compassion
* Working without enjoyment and never feeling like you've done "enough"
* Fearing failure in various forms (feedback and performance appraisals, competitions, etc)

## üö´ Procrastination

Procrastination is often avoidance of stress and discomfort, driven by some fear.

Downsides:

* Worsened health due to stress
* Feelings of regret

Do not:

* Say you're procrastinating when you're simply not prioritizing something
* Beating yourself up for procrastinating, it makes sense from an evolutionary perspective for short-term gains
* Press the "try harder" button to get things done, this will just lead to burnout.
* Treat yourself as a machine, you can't just go 2x as fast without changing the code/process in some way. Instead think in systems and how you can set yourself up for success.
Don't treat the task as an uphill boulder that's boring or meaningless; try to think of how to make the task more energizing.

Manage:

* Don't wait for motivation - do it anyway
* Sit quietly (free from distraction) and think for 15 minutes about what you're going to do (prevents avoidance behaviors, gives anxiety chance to abate)
* Break down tasks into tiny, bite sized pieces, and mark progress with smaller tasks
* Do low effort, crappy versions of task as often as you can to "lower the stakes"
* Make distractions the primary task and the primary task as the side task

## Relentless Self-Improvement

* Self-improvement means self-acceptance is conditional on "fixing" yourself, only getting a respite when you do an A+ job, meaning it's everlasting
* We think if we punish ourselves enough, we'll change. 
* Believe that we're giving up control by choosing self-acceptance, specifically, we're exerting some sort of meaningful control when we fight against something

## Low Self-Worth

*In therapy, my therapist and I were talking about my own feelings of self-worth in relationships. And she asked me to say qualities about myself that someone else would be attracted to, on a romantic and platonic level. So I mentioned some things like compassionate, empathetic and she said, "You named things that you can give someone; ways you can serve, rather than ways that you are."  And my mind was blown. That's going to stick with me forever. She then proceeded to tell me actual innate qualities about myself that she liked and thought anyone else would like as well and I hadn't even considered those because, like she said, I was focused on things I could do outwardly to attract and maintain connections rather than who I was as a person.*

Can be conflated with self-esteem, which is a more transient version. Instead of focusing on specific traits, skills, circumstances, or achievements, self-worth describes the core beliefs you have about your worth and value.

Signs:

* Conditional self-worth; only being worthy if your relationships, appearance, net worth, career, or achievements are X.
* Feeling inherently undeserving of love and belonging

Causes:

* Negative experiences in early childhood (including repeated little t traumas)
* Negative core beliefs
* Stressful life events

Treatment:

* Understand where the low self-worth criteria comes from. What makes a person worthy, what does worthiness mean, and worthy of what?
  * If there are specific criteria, like "you have to be financially independent and be married," ask "Does this apply to everybody, or just to you?" 
    * If this criteria represents your core beliefs, develop a realistic strategy to meet those goals and become worthy. 
    * Instead, if you realize you're clinging to a rigidity that you don't actually believe in, remember brains can confuse feelings for facts. So feeling undeserving can lead to your brain justifying your low self-worth, even if it doesn't align with your beliefs. Approach the issue on a metacognitive level. 

# Maladaptive Strategies

These are typically triggered by the following:

* Problems with health, finances, relationships
* Conflicts
* Stress
* Transitions
* Travel
* Insecurities and feelings of inferiority
* Loneliness
* Boredom
* Depression
* Frustration
* Resentment
* Fatigue

## üç© Emotional Eating

While emotional hunger feels the same as physical hunger, these are the signs it's happening:

* Eating outside standard meal times
* It's urgent, sudden, and unstoppable
* Want to eat a lot more than you normally would
* Craving junk food specifically
* Feeling guilty afterwards

Why it happens:

* Feel psychologically safe
* Dull/numb painful emotions
* Connection between being fed and loved
* Chewing rids energy of negative surplus
* Sugars release dopamine

Treating:

* Name and track emotions and body sensations
* Surf the urge (pay attention without trying to change it)
* Remember you can't control your thoughts, but you can control if you act on them
* Practice self-validation
* Reinforce and offer love, support, and comfort
* Clarify your needs
* Catch and reframe self-defeating thoughts
* Highlight resources to manage situation and provide hope
* Address needs and set nurturing limits

## ü§≥ Tech Addiction

Spending too much time on addictive electronic devices (computer, phone, etc), the internet, and/or social media.

Why it happens:

* Technology and devices are designed to make people get addicted; it is not a personal failing to be exploited by the technology
* Can be an educational avenue
* Desire to be informed and know what's going on
  * You'll never learn enough to get to feel you know everything that's going on; the desire just leads to endless consumption without context 
  * We are hard-wired to chase novel information, are in a world where novel information is readily accessible, and bad actors and AI exploit this

Manage:

* Seek higher quality and less addictive learning resources
* Make phone less appealing to use
  * Disable browser
  * No email (especially no work email)
  * Essential apps only, and with offline use when possible
  * Turn off notifications
  * Turn off data and wifi
  * Grayscale phone
* Practice mindfulness
* Find enjoyable offline activities to supplement spending time on technology
* Rely less on technology
  * Scrolling is not resting
  * Focus on single tasking
  * Don't rely on GPS to tell you where to go
  * Cook without a cookbook
  * Write in physical journals
  * Read physical books
  * Put phone away when talking to others
  

# Adaptive Mindsets

## Cognitive Reframing

* Once identified, begin acknowledging when and where maladaptive thoughts arise. * When these automatic thoughts pop up, start thinking about the why behind them. 
* Start questioning your assumptions and gather evidence against your biases.
* Start performing a cost-benefit analysis of your negative thoughts.
* Switch negative thoughts for positive ones.

## Emotional Regulation

* Acknowledge and name emotion; use emotions wheel below if necessary
* Pause and notice - don't avoid emotion or use distractions
* Sit in silence for a few minutes
* Don't rationalize or justify your feeling
* Accept feeling may come up again but will be less intense each consecutive time

## ü´¥ Forgiveness

*Forgiveness isn‚Äôt something you give someone else. It‚Äôs how you release yourself.*

*Many of us are ruthlessly unforgiving of ourselves when we discover we have inadvertently hurt another. Our hurtfulness seems so unforgivable that we are too ashamed to attempt an apology ‚Äì or we go to the other extreme and apologize for every subsequent breath we take. Both positions are so entrenched in self-disgust that we cannot accept genuine forgiveness even when it is offered to us.*

Psychologists generally define forgiveness as a conscious, deliberate decision to release feelings of resentment or vengeance toward a person or group who has harmed you, regardless of whether they actually deserve your forgiveness.

Forgiveness requires acknowledging the hurt the person caused us. 

* You can continue to talk about it once you've forgiven
* Forgiveness does not equal reconciliation
* Forgiving once doesn't mean you must always forgive
* Forgiveness doesn't mean you can't be angry or upset
* You can forgive and not forget

Premature forgiveness can lead to **fossilized forgiveness**, a false sense of permanent forgiveness that arises from a desire to move on from the past triggered by shame and guilt

Practice:

* Acknowledge and accept feelings without judgment; determine if you are ready to let go and forgive
* Try to understand why you did what you did and factors that influence that
* Practice self-compassion
* Make amends, if possible, and try to see things from the other person's perspective
* Write a letter saying how you were hurt, write their response, and repeat aloud until you find peace and can let go of anger 

## üôè Gratitude

Gratitude is related to happiness, but it‚Äôs an active process: It means taking time and energy to appreciate what you have and what brings meaning to your life.

* **Forced gratitude** - using the concept of gratitude to stifle a negative emotion. You can't pretend to be grateful for something you know is wrong for you - you'll neither feel good about it nor get the positive effects of actual gratitude. Example: ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm glad I have a little money in the bank.‚Äù 
* **Tragic gratitude** - recognizing there are many things to be grateful for, but also recognizing things could be a lot better.  You don‚Äôt have to pretend things are better than they are, because true gratitude isn‚Äôt fake it ‚Äôtil you make it. Example: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful I‚Äôve saved a little money, I need to come up with a plan to start saving more.‚Äù

Practice:

* Say thank you or write a thank-you note
* Give a gift
* Verbalize appreciation
* Do something thoughtful

## üÜó Radical Acceptance

Acceptance is acknowledging a particular situation is indeed happening, and making space for any part that screams "no" at the situation. The goal is to keep pain from turning into suffering. Myths:

* Acceptance does not mean we're OK with a situation or agree with it
* Acceptance does not mean we stop trying to change it
* Acceptance is not failure

Practice:

* Observe that you are questioning or fighting reality
* Remind yourself reality is what it is and cannot be changed
* Remind yourself there are causes for the reality
* Use self-talk, relaxation, mindfulness, and/or imagery to accept with your whole self
* List behvaviors you would do if you accepted the facts and do them anyway
* Imagine in your mind's eye what you would do if you accepted what seemed unacceptable
* Attend to body sensations as you think about what you need to accept
* Allow disappointment, sadness, or grief
* Acknowledge life is worth living despite and even when there is pain
* Do pros and cons if you find yourself resisting practicing acceptance

## üòä Self-Compassion

Self-compassion is being kind and understanding when confronted with personal failings (Neff, n.d.). It means that you act the same way toward yourself when you are going through a tough time that you would act towards a dear friend. Generally used to let go of perfectionism.

Involves the following:
	
* Self-kindness: being kind and understanding toward yourself. Ex: It‚Äôs okay that you failed that test. It was really hard. 
* Mindfulness: having a balanced reaction to painful thoughts and feelings, not underreacting or overreacting. Ex: I notice I‚Äôm feeling sad right now. 
* Common humanity: seeing one‚Äôs experience as part of the larger human experience. Ex: Everyone fails from time to time. 

Challenges:

* **Backdraft** - when you try to be compassionate to yourself but end up feeling worse (this is a normal thing to have happen)
* Insecure attachment styles cause fear/aversion to self-compassion
  * Contentment system is weaker (can't rely on past memories of support to self-soothe)
  * Highly active threat detection systems cause children to see need for compassion as a sign they are weak, so they resist any expression of compassion due to concerns of being rejected, harshly criticized, or feeling undeserving.
* Practice **behavioral self-compassion** when the fear of self-compassion is high. This means focusing on what is needed in the moment, like taking a break from work when stressed, rather than mental exercises.
  * What do I need to feel safe? To be comforted, soothed, validated? To protect, provide for, motivate myself?

## Vulnerability

*Until I was almost thirty my conversation seldom included anything but joke-telling and sports-talk. This superficiality made me feel perpetually lonely, even though I was popular whenever I stayed anywhere long enough to make acquaintances.*

*I was laconic because my family life convinced me it was unwise to talk about the vulnerable subjects that allow intimacy to grow between people. Talk about feelings, needs, weaknesses, or disappointments was routinely ridiculed in my house. So too was talk about hopes, dreams, and accomplishments.*

Vulnerability is what you experience when you take a risk, or leave yourself open to emotional harm. It‚Äôs what you might feel when you confess your feelings for someone or ask for feedback on a deeply personal issue‚Äîit‚Äôs the knowledge that you‚Äôve exposed an emotional weak spot and that someone could use it to hurt you.

Challenges:

* **Faux Vulnerability** - revealing facts about yourself that sound vulnerable to those on the outside but doesn't leave yourself open to emotional harm. Common with those with an avoidant attachment style.
* Don't keep being vulnerable with people who have hurt you when you're vulnerable

Practice:

* Find when it's safe to be vulnerable
  * The other person is curious about you
  * They're vulnerable with you
  * When they listen you feel heard
  * They affirm in the moment
  * They demonstrate integrity when they share other people's business
  * They consistently show up for you
  
* Recognize barriers to vulnerability   
  * Foreboding joy - always imagining worst-case scenario
  * Perfectionism
  * Numbing
  * Emotional dumping and oversharing
* Be willing to be vulnerable first
  * Show vulnerability through demeanor, not just words (cry, shake, etc)
  * Others won't judge you for your vulnerability, may help you be perceived more positively as authentic and honest
  * Being invulnerable doesn't abolish weaknesses, just also hides strengths
* Turn to friends for support when needed
* Scaffolding vulnerability by disclosing to someone you trust, and then being vulnerable with someone who you‚Äôre less sure of.

# Adaptive Activities

## ü´Å Breathing

Methods:

* **Downregulating** - use when highly anxious. Make out breaths longer than in breaths.
  * When inhaling, take a small second breath to inhale slightly extra before breathing out through the mouth to slow your heartbeat and ground you quicker.
* **Upregulating** - use when in a freeze response. Make in breaths longer than out breaths.

## ‚úç Journaling 

Strategies:

* **Morning Pages** - Write by hand three pages of an A5 notebook words that nobody will ever see. Just do stream of consciousness; the words can be whatever you want.

Note:

* Beware ‚Äòdataism‚Äô - in case where people are shown the data, people might ‚Äòedit their experiences and negotiate with the data‚Äô she says. Yes, they might say: I remember now, I was feeling stressed out that day I had the higher heart rate. They are persuaded to ‚Äòretell the narratives of their life to fit the data‚Äô, instead of trusting themselves. 

## ‚õ≥ Leisure 

Two types of leisure:

* **Terminal Leisure** ‚Äì leisure that takes place purely for enjoyment. 
* **Instrumental Leisure** ‚Äì leisure that might serve a larger purpose, like making friends or staying healthy, and therefore feels more productive. 

The ability to enjoy terminal leisure is a stronger predictor of wellbeing than enjoyment of instrumental leisure, the study showed. 

## üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Mindfulness 

Mindfulness can harm if done recklessly. Practice in moderation as you slowly build tolerance.

## ‚ò∫Ô∏è Self-Soothing

## üõãÔ∏è Therapy

* Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
* Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)
* Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR)
* Ideal Parent Figure
* Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)

### Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)

* Cognitive Defusion
  * Relating to your thoughts in a new way, so they have much less impact and influence on you
* Expansion
  * Make room for unpleasant feelings and sensations instead of trying to suppress them or push them away
* Notice Yourself Noticing Situations (The Observing Self)
  * ie, you are not your thoughts
* Connect with the Present Moment
* Clarify your Values and 
* Make Values-Driven Decisions

Strategies:

* I‚Äôm Having the Thought That - awareness between having the thought and getting caught up in the narrative
* Musical Thinking - sing-song in head for negative thoughts
* Naming Stories - label stories when your brain begins to tell them; benefits are like labeling emotions
* Thank Mind - when brain continues to retell/rehash narratives
* Silly Voices Technique - Hear thoughts in a silly character's voice, like a cartoon character
* TV Screen - imagine thoughts are like a TV show. Make it a specific genre, with specific music and acting, to help detach self from thought.
  * Distort image by flipping upside down, spinning it around, stretch image beyond bounds of screen, make black and white, etc.
  * If thoughts are more like a movie clip, play in slow motion, play backwards, play forward in double speed
  * Apply silly subtitles or voiceovers to the movie
  * Add a ridiculous musical soundtrack
  * Shift the location and the genre
* Demons on the Boat - imagine demons are around you and allowed to be around all the ship. Don't try and keep them below deck in repression. 
* Clouds in the sky ‚Äì  see your mind as a sky and thoughts are just clouds passing you by.
* River stream ‚Äì Everything is in a constant state of flux ‚Äì and your thoughts, feelings, and experiences flow through consciousness in the same way water flows through a stream. Your mind is the river and your thoughts are just things flowing down it. Give it time and it will pass.
* Suggestion box ‚Äì Your mind is genuinely trying to help and serve your best interests, but it doesn‚Äôt always suggest the best ideas, and you have the power to veto any thought you have
* Feeding the wolves - if one wolf represents light and hope and the other represents darkness and despair, the wolf you feed will win
* Burning your thoughts ‚Äì One fun exercise for overcoming negative thoughts and stripping them of their power is to burn away negative thoughts. Just get a piece of paper and a pen, then write down 5-7 negative thoughts that have been occupying your mind lately. Then get a lighter and find a safe place to burn the piece of paper
* Passengers on a bus - you visualize yourself as a bus driver, and every thought you have is a passenger that gets on (and off) the bus.
* Brain Drain - Give yourself 5-10 minutes to write whatever comes to your mind, without any self-filtering or self-editing. This completely ‚Äústream of consciousness‚Äù writing can often help to purge thoughts that have been hanging around in your head (even ones that you may not be aware of). 

### üß† Brainspotting

In a nutshell, through some quirk of the brain, stuck trauma can actually be accessed through the visual cortex. Brainspotting takes advantage of this to help process trauma. By identifying eye positions correlating with emotional activation, healing and release through the mind-body connection can occur.

### üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Internal Family Systems (IFS)

IFS believes that a person's personality is made up of various parts:

* Core Self / Wise Adult
  * Purpose: Creative, Curious, Compassionate, Confident. In more polarized systems, parts generally don't trust the Core Self's leadership and wisdom
  * Goal: differentiate the core self from other blended parts, improve self-leadership across your parts, improve inner harmony and reduce polarization between parts
* Exiles
  * Purpose: Hold disowned and painful feelings and traumatic memories. They are most commonly child and teenaged parts.
  * Goal: be acknowledged, unburdened, reassured, and nurtured by the self. Stop hijacking the system in times of distress.
* Managers
  * Purpose: Suppress and contain exiled parts, Protect the system and focus on daily living tasks
  * Goal: Let go of extreme roles, adapt role to present day needs, and work under Core Self leadership, be more trusting of Core Self
* Firefighters
  * Purpose: Use extreme measures to distract, dissociate, and numb the system when the Exiles are triggered
  * Goal: No longer needed to perform their extreme roles

Goals of IFS:

* Liberate parts from the roles they‚Äôve been forced into, so they can be who they‚Äôre designed to be.
* Restore trust in the Self and Self-leadership.
* Reharmonize the inner system.
* Become more Self-led in your interactions with the world.

### üìî Narrative Therapy

People are made up of many narratives.  Narrative therapy begins with investigating your narrative and bringing it to your awareness.

* Externalizing
  * Viewing a problem as separate from yourself
* Deconstructing
  * Be curious and investigative as you break the story down into smaller parts
* Reauthoring
  * Taking what you learned from deconstructing and putting back together to understand the stories in a different way
* Remembering
  * Explore the impact of figures in your life - link people with values, commitments, and preferences that contribute to a positive narrative

### ü§ï Pain Reprocessing Therapy

*"It's so hard to make people feel anything other than pain." - the consequence of people interacting with each other relative to AI systems.*

A modality for treating chronic pain that is driven by the mind-body connection. This modality purports that the causes of chronic pain are tied to childhood trauma and major life events (serious illness or injury, death of a loved one, loss of a relationship, etc), and neural pathways become wired to encourage further pain, leading to a self-perpetuating cycle.

Pain comes from the brain and nervous system; it is not a purely physical experience, and thus can be changed. It is designed to protect you, and part of the recovery process is learning just what it's trying to protect you from.

Personality traits associated with chronic pain include:

* Hypersensitivity (can be more of a physiological trait)
* Perfectionism
* Strong Inner Critic
* People-Pleasing
* Negative Thinking and Pessimism
	* Tackle with Cognitive Behavioral Techniques
* Lack of Joy and Play
* Lack of Self-Compassion and Gratitude
* Difficulty Setting Boundaries with Others
* Pain Catastrophizing
	* Do you magnify pain in mind?
	* Do you ruminate about pain?
  * Do you feel helpless; convinced it'll never get better?

Signs of not coping well:

* Regular doctor and healthcare visits
* Clinging to ambiguous diagnoses as your identity
* Spending more time on bed or couch
* Staying in pajamas all day
* Dropping old hobbies without warning; fewer hobbies or pleasurable activities in general (less socializing, exercise, etc)
* Missing work and sleeping during the day
* Needing pain medication
* Fewer chores done
* Self-soothing with food

Recovery from chronic pain is not a linear process; relapses will happen and that is NORMAL! Steps to recovery are as follows:

* Understand Pain Triggers
  * Emotions: Anger, Sadness, Shame, Loneliness, Fear, Numbness, etc
  * Situations: Conflict, job loss, missing out on activities due to illness, etc 
  * Biological: Poor sleep, poor diet, dehydration, bright lights and loud noises, lack of exercise, etc
  * Mental: Negative self-talk, pressure to fix yourself and/or be perfect, 
* Understand Conditioned Responses
  * Brains can make unfortunate connections and associations, even if they aren't true or helpful, in an attempt to keep you safe
  * Not pain specific; can be "standing in a crowd causes a panic attack" or "standing causes pain"
* Reinforce Evidence of Pain Being Neuroplastic / Triggered by Fear
  * Pain moves around entire body
  * Becomes more intense (or disappears) when emotions run high
  * Search for general exceptions to rule you have noticed in the past
  * If feeling really stuck, imagine a miracle - what would your life be like if the pain all disappeared tomorrow? What would you do?
  * Allow for hope for the future by saying "yet" at the end of negative thoughts
  * In general, give the pain voice less airtime and/or don't take it as seriously
* Somatic Tracking
  * Mindfulness of sensations within the body with no agenda or judgment
    * What do you notice happening to the sensation as you focus on it? Does it intensify or subside? Does it spread out or contract? Does it move around or stay exactly the same? Does the quality of the sensation change at all?
    * If that doesn't work: Visualize the pain as toxic black ooze and envision it leaving the body
  * Cognitive Soothing - Send messages of safety to the brain
    * ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be okay either way‚Äù is a type of safety reappraisal that can be really effective in the face of uncertainty
    * When fear thoughts arise notice them, don't buy into them, and send a message of safety anyways
  * Positive Affect Induction - approach sensations with lightness and curiosity; turn down the intensity and watching it like a hawk
  * Outcome Independence - feeling successful regardless of the result (do not do somatic tracking with the goal of eradicating your pain)
* Develop Corrective Experiences
  * Feeling safe during exposure to the source of your fear; requires repeated events to rewire your brain to accept that an experience/emotion/sensation/etc is safe
  * Beware Extinction Bursts - where symptoms intensify as the brain makes a last-ditch effort to maintain the current behavior. Ride the wave and do not give into the fear
* Minimize Use of Avoidance Behaviors
  * Beware Vampire Mode - what we do affects how we think and feel. Withdrawing from pleasant experiences (leaving the house, seeing friends, working, hobbies, exercising, sunlight and fresh air, etc) will cause a crash in mood and make you feel worse as you feel more excluded socially and professionally
* Reduce Hypervigilance and Allow for Pleasant Sensations
* Understand Relapses
  * Stages are Panic, Forcing It (doing the same recovery steps with desperation), Stabilization (doing recovery steps with the right intentions)
  * Digging into weeds on childhood trauma and constantly revisiting isn't always the answer to reducing pain

### Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO DBT)

*We don‚Äôt feel connected because we feel safe. We feel safe because we feel connected.*

Radically Open DBT is meant for disorders of overcontrol (OC) and people with avoidant attachment styles. The core problem with OC clients include social signaling deficits, low openness, and aloofness. [Difference between DBT vs RO DBT](https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/professional/how-is-ro-dbt-different-from-dbt/)

Overall, clients need to let go of always striving to perform better or try harder.

Signs of OC:

* Inhibited and disingenuous emotional expression
  * Fear of expressing a different opinion
  * Hiding how you're feeling
    * Saying you're fine when you're not
    * Never wanting others to know when you're upset, in distress
    * Avoiding and deflecting answering questions
* Hyper detailed, focused, and overly cautious behavior
* Rigid and rule-governed behavior
  * Constantly seeing mistakes everywhere, especially yourself
  * Foreboding joy - always expecting the other shoe to drop
  * Need to plan and prepare for everything
* Aloof and distant style of relating
  * Avoiding eye contact
  * Keeping self physically small, closed off body language
  * Leaving when uncomfortable, especially during conflicts
  * Pride in extreme self-control abilities
  * Only laughing/smiling when a joke is truly funny
  * Delay or avoid returning calls and texts
* High social comparison, envy, and bitterness

Skills:

* Self-enquiry
  * Mindfulness practice that patients can use to better understand themselves and why they interact with the world in the way they do
* Use social signaling to attract others and feel safe by activating your social safety system
* Practice urge surfing when unwanted impulses occur
* Practice compassion when in a fixed and fatalistic mindset; aim to adapt a flexible mindset
* Cultivate healthy self-doubt
  * We don‚Äôt see things as they are but rather as we are.
