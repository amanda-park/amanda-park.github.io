## Decision Making

Ways to make it easier:

-   Lower the stakes - barring a severe illness, everything will be fine
-   Think in terms of experiments to take pressure off the decision and think in terms of wonder/creativity
-   Think in terms of expected value
    -   Judge based on information at the time, not hindsight bias
    -   Understand legitimate downsides and don't worry about outcome if there is a positive expected value
-   Let what you're fearful of guide you (if you're afraid it's a sign to go do it)
-   Don't let perfect be the enemy of good enough - analysis paralysis and stopping the activity is generally worse than staying consistent
    -   What is the risk of doing nothing? What would you regret a year from now not starting today?
-   Prepare a mental board of advisors (people you admire) that can give you advice on what to do next
-   Offer yourself grace when decisions don't go as planned, or when you make "hot" decisions (anxiety, scarcity, or urgency).
