# Characters

## üå± Character Arc

Shorthand for character arcs can follow with DREAM (denial, resistance, exploration, acceptance, and manifestation).

1.  **Outer Motivation**: What outer motivation (story goal) is your character pursuing to try and attain her inner motivation?
2.  **Inner Motivation**: Which of the 5 basic human needs is your character missing due to the wounding event and its after effects?
    1.  *Physiological*: the most basic and primal needs, such as food, water, shelter, sleep, and reproductive sex
    2.  *Safety and Security*: the need to be safe, in good health, and have stability, both for oneself and loved ones
    3.  *Love and Belonging*: tied to human connection and the ability to form lasting bonds, experience intimacy, feel love, and love others in turn
    4.  *Esteem and Recognition*: the need to be valued, appreciated, and recognized by others for one‚Äôs contributions, as well as to achieve higher levels of worthiness, self-respect, and confidence
    5.  *Self-Actualization*: the need to attain fulfillment through the realization of one‚Äôs potential. This might come in the form of pursuing and achieving meaningful goals, seeking knowledge, attaining spiritual enlightenment, or embracing core values, beliefs, and an identity so one may live one‚Äôs truth
3. **Outer Conflict**: What external forces (people, organizations, natural or supernatural phenomena, etc.) are blocking your character from achieving her outer motivation? 
4. **Inner Conflict**: What internal difficulties (doubts, temptations, secrets, moral dilemmas, flaws that thwart  success, opposing desires or goals, etc.) are making it hard for your character to achieve her outer motivation?
5. **The Lie**: What false belief (No one could ever love me; I can‚Äôt trust my own instincts; People are inherently evil, etc.) does the character now embrace because of the wounding event? This could be a belief about herself, an organization, a certain group of people, or the world at large. 
6. **Wound**: What traumatic past experience caused the character deep psychological pain that continues to significantly impair her into the present? 
7. **Fear**: What specific fear resulted from the wounding event that is now driving the character‚Äôs behavior?
8. **Resolution**: Briefly explain the steps your character will take to come to grips with her past. Make note of specific circumstances or opportunities that will allow her to gain perspective regarding the wounding event,  refute the lie she has come to believe, and reject her emotional shielding so she can achieve the goal that will  restore her missing need. Use whatever format works best for you, be it an overall summary of what the character will learn or a bullet list of events that will effect change.

## üñåÔ∏è Creating a Character

Tips to make characters distinct:

* Don't make them sound the same with dialogue
* Give them different visual styles
* No names that are similar
* Play up different quirks
* Dig deep on their personalities

Avoid unsympathetic characters:

* Unrelatable background
* Lacking self-awareness or introspection
* Self-aware - and still unlikable
* Questionable motives
* Cruel, selfish, illogical actions
* Hoisted by their own petard
* Either tons of character flaws or none

### Reverse Backstory Tool

* What is the character's goal / outer motivation?
* What attributes will help achieve this goal?
* What positive emotions does this character feel because of these attributes?
* Emotionally speaking, why do they want to achieve this?
* What needs drive this character's behavior?
* What flaws get in the way of this goal?
* What painful emotions do the flaws protect against?
* What traumatic event triggered these same emotions in an intense, life-changing way? (Wound)
* Because of the wounding event, what incorrect belief does the character hold to be true? (The Lie)

## ü©π Wounds

A character wound leads to psychological pain and the paralyzing belief that it could happen again. Fear develops based on the type of wound. The character's actions and choices shift to prevent situations where this might come to pass.

Emotional shielding shows up through flaws, dysfunctional behaviors and habits, biases, a negative outlook or attitude, and/or the lie the character believes.

# Story / Plot

## Character Archetypes

### Protagonist

The protagonist is the character who drives the plot, pursues the main goal of the story, and usually changes or grows over the course of the film. A protagonist enters the film with a goal and by the end of the film, they either achieved that goal or did not. The protagonist‚Äôs character arc is defined by the pursuit of that goal. Classic examples of protagonists from film are Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter. All stories must have a protagonist, but not all stories need a hero. 

Three types of protagonists:

* Hero - someone we can all relate to, and his downfall will fill us with pity and fear. The hero is the ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù‚Äîthe type of virtuous protagonist the audience roots for and wants to succeed. 
* Anti-hero - an unlikely protagonist who does not necessarily have virtuous or villainous qualities but who is able to behave heroically if the opportunity arises.
* Villain - the villain protagonist is the villain, an undeniable ‚Äúbad guy,‚Äù is also driving the plot as the central character. 

### Main Character

The main character (aka principal character) is a central character who acts as the audience surrogate‚Äîwe experience the story through their eyes. The main character is involved in the story, interacts with the secondary characters, and is personally impacted by the plot‚Äôs main conflict. The main character and the protagonist are often, but not always the same character.

Reasons to separate main character and protagonist:

* Unrelatable Protagonist: If the audience is not able to relate to the protagonist, the main character can be a more relatable entry-point to the story. In Tim Burton‚Äôs adaption of Charlie and the Chocolate factory, Willy Wonka is the protagonist and drives the plot, but he is also misanthropic and too kooky to be relatable for the audience. Charlie, the main character, acts as the audience surrogate. 
* Point of View: A main character can act as a plot device to reveal greater truths about your protagonist. In The Great Gatsby, for example, we are able to see the protagonist, Jay Gatsby, as a flawed and dishonest man more clearly through the eyes of the main character, Nick Carraway. 
* Added irony: A separate main character creates irony or a juxtaposition. Atticus‚Äîan adult lawyer‚Äîis the protagonist of To Kill a Mockingbird, a story about a rape trial with grown-up themes. The story, however, is told through the eyes of the main character, Scout, Atticus‚Äôs young daughter. Scout‚Äôs innocence reveals the flawed moral values of society and the adults around her. 

### Antagonist

* Villain - evil character 
* Antagonist - character that gets in the way of the character's main goal
* Obstacle - something that stands in the way of the main character
